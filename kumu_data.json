Further analysis revealed that this activity is likely part of a much larger campaign impacting not only that region but also the United States, and throughout Europe and Asia.\n\nOur analysis of the delivery document revealed it was built to load a malicious macro-enabled document from a remote server via Template Injection. These macros use BlogSpot posts to obtain a script that uses multiple Pastebin pastes to download additional scripts, which ultimately result in the final payload being RevengeRAT configured with a duckdns[.]org domain for C2. During our research, we found several related delivery documents that followed the same process to ultimately install RevengeRAT hosted on Pastebin, which suggests the actors used these TTPs throughout their attack campaign.\n\nInitially, we believed this activity to be potentially associated with the {{Gorgon Group}}. Our hypothesis was based on the high level TTPs including the use of RevengeRAT. However, Unit 42 has not yet identified direct overlaps with other high-fidelity Gorgon Group indicators. Based on this, we are not able to assign this activity to the Gorgon group with an appropriate level of certainty.\n\nIn light of that, Unit 42 refers to the activity described in this blog as the Aggah Campaign based on the actor\u2019s alias \u201chagga\u201d, which was used to split data sent to the RevengeRAT C2 server and was the name of one of the Pastebin accounts used to host the RevengeRAT payloads.",

More than half of the organizations we have observed being targeted or breached by APT5 operate in these sectors. Several times, APT5 has targeted organizations and personnel based in Southeast Asia.\n\nAPT5 has been active since at least 2007. It appears to be a large threat group that consists of several subgroups, often with distinct tactics and infrastructure. APT5 has targeted or breached organizations across multiple industries, but its focus appears to be on telecommunications and technology companies, especially information about satellite communications.\n\nAPT5 targeted the network of an electronics firm that sells products for both industrial and military applications. The group subsequently stole communications related to the firm\u2019s business relationship with a national military, including inventories and memoranda about specific products they provided.\n\nIn one case in late 2014, APT5 breached the network of an international telecommunications company. The group used malware with keylogging capabilities to monitor the computer of an executive who manages the company\u2019s relationships with other telecommunications companies.\n\nThere is some overlap with {{PittyTiger, Pitty Panda}}.",

Numbered Panda has targeted organizations in time-sensitive operations such as the Fukushima Reactor Incident of 2011, likely filling intelligence gaps in the ground cleanup/mitigation operations.  Screen saver files, which are binary executables and PDF documents, are common Numbered Panda weaponization tactics.  One of the most interesting techniques that Numbered Panda likes to use is to dynamically calculate the Command and Control (C2) port by resolving a DNS.  This effectively helps Numbered Panda bypass egress filtering implemented to prevent unauthorized communications on some enterprises.  The malware will typically use two DNS names for communication: one is used for command and control; the other is used with an algorithm to calculate the port to communicate to.",

            "description": "(Symantec) In 2009, Google was attacked by a group using the Hydraq (Aurora) Trojan horse. Symantec has monitored this group\u2019s activities for the last three years as they have consistently targeted a number of industries. Interesting highlights in their method of operations include: the use of seemingly an unlimited number of zero-day exploits, attacks on supply chain manufacturers who service the target organization, and a shift to \u201cwatering hole\u201d attacks (compromising certain websites likely to be visited by the target organization). The targeted industry sectors include, but are not restricted to; defense, various defense supply chain manufacturers, human rights and non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and IT service providers. These attackers are systematic and re-use components of an infrastructure we have termed the \u201cElderwood platform\u201d. The name \u201cElderwood\u201d comes from a source code variable used by the attackers. This attack platform enables them to quickly deploy zero-day exploits. Attacks are deployed through spear phishing emails and also, increasingly, through Web injections in watering hole attacks.\n\nIt is likely the attackers have gained access to the source code for some widely used applications, or have thoroughly reverse-engineered the compiled applications in order to discover these vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities are used as needed, often within close succession of each other if exposure of any of the vulnerabilities is imminent. The scale of the attacks, in terms of the number of victims and the duration of the attacks, are another indication of the resources available to the attackers. Victims are attacked, not for petty crime or theft, but for the wholesale gathering of intelligence and intellectual property. The resources required to identify and acquire useful information\u2014let alone analyze that information\u2014could only be provided by a large criminal organization, attackers supported by a nation state, or a nation state itself.\n\nThis group appears to be closely associated with {{Hidden Lynx, Aurora Panda}} and has infrastructure overlap with {{RedAlpha}}.\n\nCould also be related to {{Axiom, Group 72}}.",

Watering hole attacks are an increasingly popular component of APT campaigns, as many people are more aware of spear phishing and are less likely to open documents or click on links in unsolicited emails.  Watering hole attacks offer a much better chance of success because they involve compromising legitimate websites and installing malware intended to compromise website visitors. These are often popular websites frequented by people who work in specific industries or have political sympathies to which the actors want to gain access.\nIn contrast to many other APT campaigns, which tend to rely heavily on spear phishing to gain victims, \u201cth3bug\u201d is known for compromising legitimate websites their intended visitors are likely to frequent.  Over the summer they compromised several sites, including a well-known Uyghur website written in that native language.\n\nThis group could be related to {{Axiom, Group 72}}.",

Their targets have also included the governments of members of the Commonwealth of Independent States; Asian, African, and Middle Eastern governments; organizations associated with Chechen extremism; and Russian speakers engaged in the illicit trade of controlled substances and drugs.\n\nThe Dukes are known to employ a vast arsenal of malware toolsets, which we identify as MiniDuke, CosmicDuke, OnionDuke, CozyDuke, CloudDuke, SeaDuke, HammerDuke, PinchDuke, and GeminiDuke. In recent years, the Dukes have engaged in apparently biannual large-scale spear-phishing campaigns against hundreds or even thousands of recipients associated with governmental institutions and affiliated organizations.\n\nThese campaigns utilize a smash-and-grab approach involving a fast but noisy break-in followed by the rapid collection and exfiltration of as much data as possible. If the compromised target is discovered to be of value, the Dukes will quickly switch the toolset used and move to using stealthier tactics focused on persistent compromise and long-term intelligence gathering.\n\nIn addition to these large-scale campaigns, the Dukes continuously and concurrently engage in smaller, much more targeted campaigns, utilizing different toolsets. These targeted campaigns have been going on for at least 7 years. The targets and timing of these campaigns appear to align with the known foreign and security policy interests of the Russian Federation at those times.",

Between these, we\u2019ve observed a couple of incidents which are so unusual in many ways that we-ve decided to analyse them in depth.\nhttps://securelist.com/the-miniduke-mystery-pdf-0-day-government-spy-assembler-0x29a-micro-backdoor/31112/\r\n**2013**: While the old style Miniduke implants were used to target mostly government victims, the new style CosmicDuke implants have a somehow different typology of victims. The most unusual is the targeting of individuals that appear to be involved in the traffic and reselling of controlled and illegal substances, such as steroids and hormones. These victims in the NITRO project have been observed only in Russia.\nhttps://securelist.com/miniduke-is-back-nemesis-gemina-and-the-botgen-studio/64107/\r\n**2013**: Operation \u201cGhost\u201d\nWe call these newly uncovered Dukes campaigns, collectively, Operation Ghost, and describe how the group  has been busy compromising government targets, including three European Ministries of Foreign Affairs and the Washington DC embassy of a European Union country, all without drawing attention to their activities.\nhttps://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/ESET_Operation_Ghost_Dukes.pdf\r\n**2014-03**: Operation \u201cOffice monkeys\u201d\nIn March 2014, a Washington, D.C.-based private research institute was found to have CozyDuke (Trojan.Cozer) on their network. Cozy Bear then started an email campaign attempting to lure victims into clicking on a flash video of office monkeys that would also include malicious executables. By July the group had compromised government networks and directed CozyDuke-infected systems to install MiniDuke onto a compromised network.\nhttps://www.symantec.com/connect/blogs/forkmeiamfamous-seaduke-latest-weapon-duke-armory\r\n**2015-08**: Attack on the Pentagon in the USA\nIn August 2015 Cozy Bear was linked to a spear-phishing cyberattack against the Pentagon email system causing the shutdown of the entire Joint Staff unclassified email system and Internet access during the investigation.\nhttps://www.cnbc.com/2015/08/06/russia-hacks-pentagon-computers-nbc-citing-sources.html\r\n**2016-06**: Breach of Democratic National Committee\nIn June 2016, Cozy Bear was implicated alongside the hacker group {{Sofacy, APT 28, Fancy Bear, Sednit}} had only been there a few weeks. Cozy Bear\u2019s more sophisticated tradecraft and interest in traditional long-term espionage suggest that the group originates from a separate Russian intelligence agency.\nhttps://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/bears-midst-intrusion-democratic-national-committee/\r\n**2016-08**: Attacks on US think tanks and NGOs\nAfter the United States presidential election, 2016, Cozy Bear was linked to a series of coordinated and well-planned spear-phishing campaigns against U.S.-based think tanks and non-governmental organizations (NGOs).\nhttps://www.volexity.com/blog/2016/11/09/powerduke-post-election-spear-phishing-campaigns-targeting-think-tanks-and-ngos/\r\n**2017-01**: Attacks on the Norwegian Government\nOn February 3, 2017, the Norwegian Police Security Service (PST) reported that attempts had been made to spear-phish the email accounts of nine individuals in the Ministry of Defense, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Labour Party. The acts were attributed to Cozy Bear, whose targets included the Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority, PST section chief Arne Christian Haugst\u00f8yl, and an unnamed college.\nhttps://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2017/02/03/norway-russian-hackers-hit-spy-agency-defense-labour-party/97441782/\r\n**2017-02**: Attack on Dutch ministries\nIn February 2017, the General Intelligence and Security Service (AIVD) of the Netherlands revealed that Fancy Bear and Cozy Bear had made several attempts to hack into Dutch ministries, including the Ministry of General Affairs, over the previous six months. Rob Bertholee, head of the AIVD, said on EenVandaag that the hackers were Russian and had tried to gain access to secret government documents.\nhttps://www.volkskrant.nl/cultuur-media/russen-faalden-bij-hackpogingen-ambtenaren-op-nederlandse-ministeries~b77ff391/\r\n**2017-09**: Russian hackers breached Dutch police systems in 2017\nhttps://therecord.media/russian-hackers-breached-dutch-police-systems-in-2017/\r\n**2018-11**: Phishing campaign in the USA\nTarget: Multiple industries, including think tank, law enforcement, media, U.S. military, imagery, transportation, pharmaceutical, national government, and defense contracting.\nMethod: Phishing email appearing to be from the U.S. Department of State with links to zip files containing malicious Windows shortcuts that delivered Cobalt Strike Beacon.\nhttps://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2018/11/not-so-cozy-an-uncomfortable-examination-of-a-suspected-apt29-phishing-campaign.html\r\n**2019-08**: SolarWinds Orion Supply-chain Attack\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/yu5uwsfyo9q4oj2/Whitepaper%20SolarWinds%20Orion%20Supply-chain%20Attack.pdf?dl=0\r\n**2020**: Throughout 2020, APT29 has targeted various organisations involved in COVID-19 vaccine development in Canada, the United States and the United Kingdom, highly likely with the intention of stealing information and intellectual property relating to the development and testing of COVID-19 vaccines.\nhttps://www.ncsc.gov.uk/files/Advisory-APT29-targets-COVID-19-vaccine-development.pdf\r\n**2021-05**: Suspected APT29 Operation Launches Election Fraud Themed Phishing Campaigns\nhttps://www.volexity.com/blog/2021/05/27/suspected-apt29-operation-launches-election-fraud-themed-phishing-campaigns/\r\n**2021-06**: New Nobelium activity\nhttps://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2021/06/25/new-nobelium-activity/\r\n**2021-06**: Bear Tracks: Infrastructure Patterns Lead to More Than 30 Active APT29 C2 Servers\nhttps://www.riskiq.com/blog/external-threat-management/apt29-bear-tracks/\r\n**2021-07**: Russia \u2018Cozy Bear\u2019 Breached GOP as Ransomware Attack Hit\nhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-07-06/russian-state-hackers-breached-republican-national-committee\r\n",

            "description": "APT 30 is a threat group suspected to be associated with the Chinese government. While {{Naikon, Lotus Panda}} shares some characteristics with APT 30, the two groups do not appear to be exact matches.\n\n(FireEye) When our Singapore-based FireEye labs team examined malware aimed predominantly at entities in Southeast Asia and India, we suspected that we were peering into a regionally focused cyber espionage operation. The malware revealed a decade-long operation focused on targets\u2014government and commercial\u2014who hold key political, economic, and military information about the region. This group, who we call APT30, stands out not only for their sustained activity and regional focus, but also for their continued success despite maintaining relatively consistent tools, tactics, and infrastructure since at least 2005.\n\nBased on our knowledge of APT30\u2019s targeting activity and tools, their objective appears to be data theft as opposed to financial gain. APT30 has not been observed to target victims or data that can be readily monetized (for example, credit card data, personally identifiable information, or bank transfer credentials). Instead, their tools include functionality that allows them to identify and steal documents, including what appears to be an interest in documents that may be stored on air-gapped networks.\n\nThe group expresses a distinct interest in organizations and governments associated with ASEAN, particularly so around the time of official ASEAN meetings.\n\nMany of APT30\u2019s decoy documents use topics related to Southeast Asia, India, border areas, and broader security and diplomatic issues. Decoy documents attached to spear phishing emails are frequently indicators of intended targeting because threat actors generally tailor these emails to entice their intended targets \u2014who typically work on related issues\u2014to click on the attachments and infect themselves.\n\nIn addition to APT30\u2019s Southeast Asia and India focus, we\u2019ve observed APT30 target journalists reporting on issues traditionally considered to be focal points for the Chinese Communist Party\u2019s sense of legitimacy, such as corruption, the economy, and human rights. In China, the Communist Party has the ultimate authority over the government. China-based threat groups have targeted journalists before; we believe they often do so to get a better understanding on developing stories to anticipate unfavorable coverage and better position themselves to shape public messaging.",

            "operations": "**2014-04**: Operation \u201cPhantomLance\u201d\nIn July 2019, Dr. Web reported about a backdoor trojan in Google Play, which appeared to be sophisticated and unlike common malware often uploaded for stealing victims\u2019 money or displaying ads. So, we conducted an inquiry of our own, discovering a long-term campaign, which we dubbed \u201cPhantomLance\u201d, its earliest registered domain dating back to December 2015.\nhttps://securelist.com/apt-phantomlance/96772/\nhttps://labs.bitdefender.com/2020/05/android-campaign-from-known-oceanlotus-apt-group-potentially-older-than-estimated-abused-legitimate-certificate/\r\n**2014-12**: These applications disguise as a normal application, and their icons will hide automatically after they are running. They will release malicious sub-packages in the background, receive the remote control command, steal the privacy information of users such as SMS messages, contacts, call records, geographic locations, and browser records. They also download apks secretly and record audios and videos, then upload users\u2019 privacy information to server, causing users\u2019 privacy leakage.\nhttps://www.antiy.net/p/analysis-of-the-attack-of-mobile-devices-by-oceanlotus/\r\n**2015-08**: Terracotta VPN\nDubbed by RSA as \u201cTerracotta VPN\u201d (a reference to the Chinese Terracotta Army), this satellite array of VPN services \u201cmay represent the first exposure of a PRC-based VPN operation that maliciously, efficiently and rapidly enlists vulnerable servers around the world,\u201d the company said in a report released today.\nhttps://krebsonsecurity.com/2015/08/chinese-vpn-service-as-attack-platform/\r\n**2016-09**: Blackberry Cylance threat researchers have analyzed the Ratsnif  rojans, which offer a veritable swiss-army knife of network attack techniques. The  rojans, under active development since 2016, combine capabilities like packet sniffing, gateway/device ARP poisoning, DNS poisoning, HTTP injection, and MAC spoofing.\nhttps://threatvector.cylance.com/en_us/home/threat-spotlight-ratsnif-new-network-vermin-from-oceanlotus.html\r\n**2017-03**: Breach of the ASEAN website\nSteven Adair, founder and CEO, said the hacking group was still active, and had compromised the website of the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) over several high-profile summit meetings. ASEAN is holding another summit of regional leaders in the Philippines capital Manila this week.\nhttps://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-attack-vietnam/vietnams-neighbors-asean-targeted-by-hackers-report-idUSKBN1D70VU\r\n**2017-05**: Operation \u201cCobalt Kitty\u201d\nDubbed Operation Cobalt Kitty, the APT targeted a global corporation based in Asia with the goal of stealing proprietary business information. The threat actor targeted the company\u2019s top-level management by using spear-phishing attacks as the initial penetration vector, ultimately compromising the computers of vice presidents, senior directors and other key personnel in the operational departments. During Operation Cobalt Kitty, the attackers compromised more than 40 PCs and servers, including the domain controller, file servers, Web application server and database server.\nhttps://www.cybereason.com/blog/operation-cobalt-kitty-apt\r\n**2017-05**: Mass Digital Surveillance and Attacks Targeting ASEAN, Asian Nations, the Media, Human Rights Groups, and Civil Society\nIn May 2017, Volexity identified and started tracking a very sophisticated and extremely widespread mass digital surveillance and attack campaign targeting several Asian nations, the ASEAN organization, and hundreds of individuals and organizations tied to media, human rights and civil society causes. These attacks are being conducted through numerous strategically compromised websites and have occurred over several high-profile ASEAN summits.\nhttps://www.volexity.com/blog/2017/11/06/oceanlotus-blossoms-mass-digital-surveillance-and-exploitation-of-asean-nations-the-media-human-rights-and-civil-society/\r\n**2017-10**: During an incident response investigation in the final quarter of 2017, Cylance incident responders and threat researchers uncovered several bespoke backdoors deployed by OceanLotus Group (a.k.a. APT32, Cobalt Kitty), as well as evidence of the threat actor using obfuscated CobaltStrike Beacon payloads to perform C2.\nhttps://threatvector.cylance.com/en_us/home/report-the-spyrats-of-oceanlotus.html\r\n**2018 Early**: KerrDown downloader\nWe identified two methods to deliver the KerrDown downloader to targets. One is using the Microsoft Office Document with a malicious macro and the other is RAR archive which contains a legitimate program with DLL side-loading. For RAR archive files, the file names used to trick targets are all in Vietnamese as shown in Figure 11. Our analysis shows that the primary targets of the ongoing campaign discussed in this blog are either in Vietnam or Vietnamese speaking individuals.\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/tracking-oceanlotus-new-downloader-kerrdown/\r\n**2018-03**: OceanLotus ships new backdoor using old tricks\nhttps://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/03/13/oceanlotus-ships-new-backdoor/\r\n**2018-04**: New MacOS Backdoor\nThe MacOS backdoor was found in a malicious Word document presumably distributed via email. The document bears the filename \u201c2018-PHI\u1ebeU  GHI  DANH  THAM  D\u1ef0  T\u0128NH  H\u1ed8I HMDC 2018.doc,\u201d which translates to \u201c2018-REGISTRATION FORM OF HMDC ASSEMBLY 2018.doc.\u201d The document claims to be a registration form for an event with HDMC, an organization in Vietnam that advertises national independence and democracy.\nhttps://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/new-macos-backdoor-linked-to-oceanlotus-found/\r\n**2018-04**: Steganography to Shroud Payloads\nThe OceanLotus APT is using two new loaders which use steganography to read their encrypted payloads.\nhttps://threatpost.com/oceanlotus-apt-uses-steganography-to-shroud-payloads/143373/\r\n**2018-05**: Watering Hole Attack using the Phnom Penh Post website\nThe attack started just days after Australian mining magnate Bill Clough sold the newspaper to Malaysian spin doctor Sivakumar Ganapathy, who specializes in \u201ccovert PR\u201d.\n\u201cSince last Tuesday [May 8], computers in our office were targeted by a malicious piece of code when we visited the Phnom Penh Post website,\u201d said Naly Pilorge, director of Licadho \u2014 one of Cambodia\u2019s leading human rights groups.\nhttps://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-05-15/hackers-trigger-software-trap-after-phnom-penh-post-sale/9763906\r\n**2018 Mid**: Equation Editor exploit\nIn mid-2018, OceanLotus carried out a campaign using documents abusing the weakness exposed by the CVE-2017-11882 vulnerability. Indeed, several Proofs-of-Concept were made available. The vulnerability resides in the component responsible for rendering and editing mathematical equations.\nhttps://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/03/20/fake-or-fake-keeping-up-with-oceanlotus-decoys/\r\n**2018-09**: Watering Hole Attack in Southeast Asia\nESET researchers have discovered a new watering hole campaign targeting several websites in Southeast Asia, and that is believed to have been active since September 2018. This campaign stands out because of its large scale, as we were able to identify 21 compromised websites, some of which are particularly notable. Among the compromised websites were the Ministry of Defense of Cambodia, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Cooperation of Cambodia and several Vietnamese newspaper or blog websites.\nhttps://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/11/20/oceanlotus-new-watering-hole-attack-southeast-asia/\r\n**2019-01**: Self-Extracting archives\nAfter using RTF files, the group started using self-extracting (SFX) archives that use common document icons in an attempt to further mislead their victims. It was briefly documented by Threatbook (in Chinese). When run, these self-extracting RAR files drop and execute DLL files (with a .ocx extension) with the final payload being the previously documented {A96B020F-0000-466F-A96D-A91BBF8EAC96}.dll. Since the middle of January 2019, OceanLotus began reusing the technique but changed some configuration over time.\r\n**2019-03**: macOS malware update\nEarly in March 2019, a new macOS malware sample from the OceanLotus group was uploaded to VirusTotal, a popular online multi-scanner service. This backdoor executable bears the same features as the previous macOS variant we looked at, but its structure has changed and its detection was made harder. Unfortunately, we couldn\u2019t find the dropper associated with this sample so we do not know the initial compromise vector.\nhttps://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/04/09/oceanlotus-macos-malware-update/\r\n**2019-03**: Malicious macro armed documents likely targeting ASEAN affairs and meeting members. Telemetry and spreading statistics related to these decoy documents highlight their diffusion in the geographical area of Thailand.\nhttps://brica.de/alerts/alert/public/1258637/oceanlotus-on-asean-affairs/\r\n**2019-03**: Breach of Toyota in Australia, Japan, Thailand and Vietnam\nToyota said the servers that hackers accessed stored sales information on up to 3.1 million customers. The carmaker said there\u2019s an ongoing investigation to find out if hackers exfiltrated any of the data they had access to.\nhttps://www.zdnet.com/article/toyota-announces-second-security-breach-in-the-last-five-weeks/\r\n**2019-05**: Attacks to Indochinese Peninsula\nIn this report, we share our summary of the latest attack techniques, attack payloads and related attacks of the OceanLotus, hoping that we can jointly improve understanding of OceanLotus group, an extremely active APT group.\nhttps://ti.qianxin.com/blog/articles/oceanlotus-attacks-to-indochinese-peninsula-evolution-of-targets-techniques-and-procedure/\r\n**2019-12**: Breach of BMW and Hyundai\nhttps://www.zdnet.com/article/bmw-and-hyundai-hacked-by-vietnamese-hackers-report-claims/\r\n**2020-01**: Vietnamese Threat Actors APT32 Targeting Wuhan Government and Chinese Ministry of Emergency Management in Latest Example of COVID-19 Related Espionage\nhttps://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2020/04/apt32-targeting-chinese-government-in-covid-19-related-espionage.html\r\n**2020**: Throughout the year, Volexity identified multiple Vietnamese-language news websites that appeared to be compromised, as they were being used to load an OceanLotus web profiling framework.\nhttps://www.volexity.com/blog/2020/11/06/oceanlotus-extending-cyber-espionage-operations-through-fake-websites/\r\n**2020-07**: New APT32 Malware Campaign Targets Cambodian Government\nhttps://www.recordedfuture.com/apt32-malware-campaign/\r\n**2020-11**: New MacOS Backdoor Connected to OceanLotus Surfaces\nhttps://www.trendmicro.com/en_us/research/20/k/new-macos-backdoor-connected-to-oceanlotus-surfaces.html\r\n",

However, over the past few years, we have been tracking a separate, less widely known suspected Iranian group with potential destructive capabilities, whom we call APT33. Our analysis reveals that APT33 is a capable group that has carried out cyber espionage operations since at least 2013. We assess APT33 works at the behest of the Iranian government.\n\nAPT33 has targeted organizations \u2013 spanning multiple industries \u2013 headquartered in the United States, Saudi Arabia and South Korea. APT33 has shown particular interest in organizations in the aviation sector involved in both military and commercial capacities, as well as organizations in the energy sector with ties to petrochemical production.\n\nAPT 33 seems to be closely related to {{OilRig, APT 34, Helix Kitten, Chrysene}} since at least 2017.",

            "description": "(FireEye) FireEye Threat Intelligence assesses with high confidence that APT41 is a prolific cyber threat group that carries out Chinese state-sponsored espionage activity in addition to financially motivated activity potentially outside of state control. Activity traces back to 2012 when individual members of APT41 conducted primarily financially motivated operations focused on the video game industry before expanding into likely state-sponsored activity. This is remarkable because explicit financially motivated targeting is unusual among Chinese state-sponsored threat groups, and evidence suggests these two motivations were balanced concurrently from 2014 onward.\n\n\u2022 APT41 overlaps at least partically with public reporting on group including {{Barium}} and {{Winnti Group, Blackfly, Wicked Panda}}. In some cases the primary observed similarity in the publicly reported Winnti activity was the use of the same malware \u2013 including HIGHNOON \u2013 across otherwise separate clusters of activity.\n\u2022 Previous FireEye Threat Intelligence reporting on the use of HIGHNOON and related activity was grouped together under both {{Ke3chang, Vixen Panda, APT 15, GREF, Playful Dragon}} and Mana, although we now understand this to be the work of several Chinese cyber espionage groups that share tools and digital certificates.\n\u2022 APT41 reflects our current understanding of what was previously reported as GREF, as well as additional indicators and activity gathered during our extensive review of our intelligence holdings.",

Their initial attack methodology is focused on exploiting vulnerable internet-exposed applications on webservers, in order to drop and execute a webshell. Post compromise, via the webshell, BackdoorDiplomacy deploys open-source software for reconnaissance and information gathering, and favors the use of DLL search order hijacking to install its backdoor, Turian. Finally, BackdoorDiplomacy employs a separate executable to detect removable media, likely USB flash drives, and copy their contents to the main drive\u2019s recycle bin.\n\nBackdoorDiplomacy shares tactics, techniques, and procedures with other Asian groups. Turian likely represents a next stage evolution of Quarian, the backdoor last observed in use in 2013 against diplomatic targets in Syria and the United States. Turian\u2019s network encryption protocol is nearly identical to the network encryption protocol used by Whitebird, a backdoor operated by {{Calypso}}, another Asian group. Whitebird was deployed within diplomatic organizations in Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan during the same timeframe as BackdoorDiplomacy (2017-2020). Additionally, BackdoorDiplomacy and {{Ke3chang, Vixen Panda, APT 15, GREF, Playful Dragon}} use the same techniques and tactics to drop their backdoors on systems, namely the aforementioned DLL search order hijacking.",

Recurrent patterns in hostnames, registrations, and phishing scripts provided a strong link between the two incidents, and older attempts were found that directly overlapped with these attacks. Over the course of the following months, several more attempts against the same individuals were observed, intended to steal credentials for iCloud and Gmail accounts.\n\nBahamut was also observed engaging in reconnaissance and counter-reconnaissance attempts, intended to harvest IP addresses of emails accounts. One attempt impersonated BBC News Alerts, using timely content related to the diplomatic conflict between Qatar and other Gulf states as bait. This message used external images embedded in the email to track where the lure would be opened.",

These attempts differed from other tactics seen by us elsewhere, such as those connected to Iran, with better attention paid to the operation of the campaign.\nhttps://www.bellingcat.com/news/mena/2017/06/12/bahamut-pursuing-cyber-espionage-actor-middle-east/\r\n**2017-10**: For three months there was no apparent further activity from the actor. However, in the same week of September a series of spear-phishing attempts once again targeted a set of otherwise unrelated individuals, employing the same tactics as before. Bahamut remains active, and its operations are more extensive than first disclosed.\nhttps://www.bellingcat.com/resources/case-studies/2017/10/27/bahamut-revisited-cyber-espionage-middle-east-south-asia/\r\n**2018-06**: Cisco Talos has identified a highly targeted campaign against 13 iPhones which appears to be focused on India. The attacker deployed an open-source mobile device management (MDM) system to control enrolled devices.\nhttps://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/07/Mobile-Malware-Campaign-uses-Malicious-MDM.html\r\n**2018-07**: Android-based malware with some similarities to the iOS malware we identified. That post kickstarted our investigation into any potential overlap between these campaigns and how they are potentially linked.\nThe new MDM platform we identified has similar victimology with Middle Eastern targets, namely Qatar, using a U.K. mobile number issued from LycaMobile. Bahamut targeted similar Qatar-based individuals during their campaign.\nhttps://blog.talosintelligence.com/2018/07/Mobile-Malware-Campaign-uses-Malicious-MDM-Part2.html\r\n**2020-06**: Bahamut Possibly Responsible for Multi-Stage Infection Chain Campaign\nhttps://www.anomali.com/blog/bahamut-possibly-responsible-for-multi-stage-infection-chain-campaign\r\n",

We identified one specific spear phishing campaign launched against targets within Palestine, and specifically against Palestinian law enforcement agencies. This campaign started in April 2017, using a spear phishing campaign to deliver the MICROPSIA payload in order to remotely control infected systems. Although this technique is not new, it remains an effective technique for attackers.\n\nThe malware itself was developed in Delphi; in this article, we describe the features and the network communication to the command and control server used by the attackers. The threat actor has chosen to reference TV show characters and include German language words within the attack. Most significantly, the attacker has appeared to have used genuine documents stolen from Palestinian sources as well as a controversial music video as part of the attack.\n\n(Check Point) While the APT has gone through significant upgrades over the past year, the conductors of these campaigns maintained evident fingerprints, both in the delivery methods and malware development conventions. These unique traces assisted us in correlating the current wave to past attacks, and may also have some resemblance to attacks related to the {{Molerats, Extreme Jackal, Gaza Cybergang}} APT group.",

            "description": "(Trend Micro) Blackgear is an espionage campaign which has targeted users in Taiwan for many years. Multiple papers and talks have been released covering this campaign, which used the ELIRKS backdoor when it was first discovered in 2012. It is known for using blogs and microblogging services to hide the location of its actual command-and-control (C&C) servers. This allows an attacker to change the C&C server used quickly by changing the information in these posts.\n\nLike most campaigns, Blackgear has evolved over time. Our research indicates that it has started targeting Japanese users. Two things led us to this conclusion: first, the fake documents that are used as part of its infection routines are now in Japanese. Secondly, it is now using blogging sites and microblogging services based in Japan for its C&C activity.",

The oldest sample we\u2019ve seen up to now is from November 2013.\n\nThis is not the first time the country has been a victim of an APT. However, the attack is different in two respects: unlike other APTs, the main focus of Blue Termite is to attack Japanese organizations; and most of their C2s are located in Japan. One of the top targets is the Japan Pension Service, but the list of targeted industries includes government and government agencies, local governments, public interest groups, universities, banks, financial services, energy, communication, heavy industry, chemical, automotive, electrical, news media, information services sector, health care, real estate, food, semiconductor, robotics, construction, insurance, transportation and so on. Unfortunately, the attack is still active and the number of victims has been increasing.",

CTU researchers associate this activity with the Gold Lowell threat group. Gold Lowell typically scans for and exploits known vulnerabilities in Internet-facing systems to gain an initial foothold in a victim\u2019s network. The threat actors then deploy the SamSam ransomware and demand payment to decrypt the victim\u2019s files. The consistent tools and behaviors associated with SamSam intrusions since 2015 suggest that Gold Lowell is either a defined group or a collection of closely affiliated threat actors. Applying security updates in a timely manner and regularly monitoring for anomalous behaviors on Internet-facing systems are effective defenses against these tactics. Organizations should also create and test response plans for ransomware incidents and use backup solutions that are resilient to corruption or encryption attempts.",

The number of successful attacks against Ukrainian banks has not been identified.\n\nBuhtrap is the first hacker group using a network worm to infect the overall bank infrastructure that significantly increases the difficulty of removing all malicious functions from the network. As a result, banks have to shut down the whole infrastructure which provokes delay in servicing customers and additional losses.\n\nMalicious programs intentionally scan for machines with an automated Bank-Customer system of the Central Bank of Russia (further referred to as BCS CBR). We have not identified incidents of attacks involving online money transfer systems, ATM machines or payment gates which are known to be of interest for other criminal groups.\n\nBuhtrap has some infrastructure overlap with {{TA505, Graceful Spider, Gold Evergreen}}.",

Symantec estimates that each team is made up of between 5 and 10 people.\n\nThere is evidence to suggest that the two teams may be connected in some way, though we cannot confirm this. A number of computers experienced both Cadelspy and Remexi infections within a small time window. In one instance, a computer was compromised with Backdoor.Cadelspy just minutes after being infected with Backdoor.Remexi. The Cadelle and Chafer groups also keep the same working hours and focus on similar targets. However, no sharing of C&C infrastructure between the teams has been observed.\n\nIf Cadelle and Chafer are not directly linked, then they may be separately working for a single entity.

            "description": "(F-Secure) The most obvious common theme between all known targets of the Callisto Group is an involvement in European foreign and security policy, whether as a military or government official, being employed by a think tank, or working as a journalist. More specifically, many of the known targets have a clear relation to foreign and security policy involving both Eastern Europe and the South Caucasus.\n\nThis targeting suggests the Callisto Group is interested in intelligence gathering related to foreign and security policy. Furthermore, we are unaware of any targeting in the described attacks that would suggest a financial motive.\n\nIt is worth noting that during our investigation we uncovered links between infrastructure associated with the Callisto Group and infrastructure used to host online stores selling controlled substances. While we don\u2019t yet know enough to fully understand the nature of these links, they do suggest the existence of connections between the Callisto Group and criminal actors.\n\nWhile the targeting would suggest that the main benefactor of the Callisto Group\u2019s activity is a nation state with specific interest in the Eastern Europe and South Caucasus regions, the link to infrastructure used for the sale of controlled substances hints at the involvement of a criminal element. Finally, the infrastructure associated with the Callisto Group and related infrastructure contain links to at least Russia, Ukraine, and China in both the content hosted on the infrastructure, and in WHOIS information associated with the infrastructure.\n\nIt is possible to come up with a number of plausible theories to explain the above findings. For example, a cybercrime group with ties to a nation state, such as acting on behalf of or for the benefit of a government agency, is one potential explanation. However, we do not believe it is possible to make any definitive assertions regarding the nature or affiliation of the Callisto Group based on the currently available information.",

            "description": "Carbanak is a threat group that mainly targets banks. It also refers to malware of the same name (Carbanak). It is sometimes referred to as {{FIN7}}, but these appear to be two groups using the same Carbanak malware and are therefore tracked separately.\n\n(Kaspersky) From late 2013 onwards, several banks and financial institutions have been attacked by an unknown group of cybercriminals. In all these attacks, a similar modus operandi was used. According to victims and the law enforcement agencies (LEAs) involved in the investigation, this could result in cumulative losses of up to 1 billion USD. The attacks are still active. This report provides a technical analysis of these attacks. The motivation for the attackers, who are making use of techniques commonly seen in Advanced Persistent Threats (APTs), appears to be financial gain as opposed to espionage. An analysis of the campaign has revealed that the initial infections were achieved using spear phishing emails that appeared to be legitimate banking communications, with Microsoft Word 97 \u2013 2003 (.doc) and Control Panel Applet (.CPL) files attached. We believe that the attackers also redirected to exploit kits website traffic that related to financial activity.",

            "description": "(FireEye) APT39 was created to bring together previous activities and methods used by this actor, and its activities largely align with a group publicly referred to as \u201cChafer.\u201d However, there are differences in what has been publicly reported due to the variances in how organizations track activity. APT39 primarily leverages the SEAWEED and CACHEMONEY backdoors along with a specific variant of the POWBAT backdoor. While APT39\u2019s targeting scope is global, its activities are concentrated in the Middle East. APT39 has prioritized the telecommunications sector, with additional targeting of the travel industry and IT firms that support it and the high-tech industry.\n\nAPT39\u2019s focus on the telecommunications and travel industries suggests intent to perform monitoring, tracking, or surveillance operations against specific individuals, collect proprietary or customer data for commercial or operational purposes that serve strategic requirements related to national priorities, or create additional accesses and vectors to facilitate future campaigns. Government entities targeting suggests a potential secondary intent to collect geopolitical data that may benefit nation-state decision making. Targeting data supports the belief that APT39\u2019s key mission is to track or monitor targets of interest, collect personal information, including travel itineraries, and gather customer data from telecommunications firms.",

The group hit organizations in Israel, Jordan, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Turkey.\nSectors targeted included airlines; aircraft services; software and IT services companies serving the air and sea transport sectors; telecoms services; payroll services; engineering consultancies; and document management software.</br />Outside of the Middle East, Symantec has also found evidence of attacks against one African airline and attempts to compromise an international travel reservations firm.\nhttps://www.symantec.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/chafer-latest-attacks-reveal-heightened-ambitions\r\n**2018-02**: Turkish Government Targeting\nThis new secondary payload is Python-based and compiled into executable form using the PyInstaller utility. This is the first instance where Unit 42 has identified a Python-based payload used by these operators. We\u2019ve also identified code overlap with OilRig\u2019s Clayside VBScript but at this time track Chafer and OilRig as separate threat groups. We have named this payload MechaFlounder for tracking purposes.\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/new-python-based-payload-mechaflounder-used-by-chafer/\r\n**2018 Autumn**: Spying on Iran-based foreign diplomatic entities\nThroughout the autumn of 2018 we analyzed a long-standing (and still active at that time) cyberespionage campaign that was primarily targeting foreign diplomatic entities based in Iran. The attackers were using an improved version of Remexi in what the victimology suggests might be a domestic cyberespionage operation.\nhttps://securelist.com/chafer-used-remexi-malware/89538/\r\n**2018**: Bitdefender researchers have found attacks conducted by this actor in the Middle East region, dating back to 2018. The campaigns were based on several tools, including \u201cliving off the land\u201d tools, which makes attribution difficult, as well as different hacking tools and a custom built backdoor.\nhttps://www.bitdefender.com/files/News/CaseStudies/study/332/Bitdefender-Whitepaper-Chafer-creat4491-en-EN-interactive.pdf\r\n",

We believe these attacks originated from the same threat actor \u2013 Chimera \u2013 as  these attacks utilized similar tactics, techniques and even the same customized malware. The actor likely harvested various valid credentials via phishing emails or data breaches as their starting point to conduct their cyber attack on the vendors. Cobalt Strike was later used as their main RAT tool. To avoid detection, the Cobalt Strike RAT was often masqueraded as a Google Chrome Update. The RAT would then connect back to their C2 server. As these servers were in a public cloud server, it made it difficult to track. Subsequently, by compromising the AD server, the delicate malware \u2013 SkeletonKeyInjector \u2013 was invoked to implant a general key to allow LM, persistence and defense evasion. Although this malware was discovered for the first time, we have high confidence that these attacks were conducted by the same threat actor. Based on the stolen data, we infer that the actor\u2019s goal was to harvest company trade secrets. The motive may be related to business competition or a country\u2019s industrial strategy.",

As one of the principal members of the United States Intelligence Community (IC), the CIA reports to the Director of National Intelligence and is primarily focused on providing intelligence for the President and Cabinet of the United States.\n\n(Yahoo) In September 2018, Bolton announced that Trump had signed a presidential directive easing Obama-era rules governing military cyber operations. Although the administration disclosed the existence of that directive \u2014 known as National Security Presidential Memorandum 13 \u2014 the underlying rules of engagement for military cyber operations remain secret. The administration also kept secret the CIA finding, which gave the agency its new authorities.\n\nFormer officials declined to speak in detail about cyber operations the CIA has carried out as a result of the finding, but they said the agency has already conducted covert hack-and-dump actions aimed at both Iran and Russia.\n\nThis more permissive environment may also intensify concerns about the CIA\u2019s ability to secure its hacking arsenal. In 2017, WikiLeaks published a large cache of CIA hacking tools known as \u201cVault 7\u201d (see {{[Vault 7/8]}}.) The leak, which a partially declassified CIA assessment called \u201cthe largest data loss in CIA history,\u201d was made possible by \u201cwoefully lax\u201d security practices at the CIA\u2019s top hacker unit, the assessment said.\n\nThe CIA was also one of the parties involved in {{Operation Olympic Games}} where Stuxnet was deployed in Iran.\n\nWhile not strictly related to APT activity and not just involving the CIA, the following publication in 3 parts sheds more light:\n1. https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/12/21/china-stolen-us-data-exposed-cia-operatives-spy-networks/\n2. https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/12/22/china-us-data-intelligence-cybersecurity-xi-jinping/\n3. https://foreignpolicy.com/2020/12/23/china-tech-giants-process-stolen-data-spy-agencies/\n\nThe CIA has 2 subgroups:\n1. {{Subgroup: Longhorn, The Lamberts}}.\n2. {{Subgroup: [Unnamed group USA]}}.",

It has used a range of back door Trojans in addition to zero-day vulnerabilities to compromise its targets. Longhorn has infiltrated governments and internationally operating organizations, in addition to targets in the financial, telecoms, energy, aerospace, information technology, education, and natural resources sectors. All of the organizations targeted would be of interest to a nation-state attacker.\n\nLonghorn has infected 40 targets in at least 16 countries across the Middle East, Europe, Asia, and Africa. On one occasion a computer in the United States was compromised but, following infection, an uninstaller was launched within hours, which may indicate this victim was infected unintentionally.\n\nLonghorn\u2019s malware appears to be specifically built for espionage-type operations, with detailed system fingerprinting, discovery, and exfiltration capabilities. The malware uses a high degree of operational security, communicating externally at only select times, with upload limits on exfiltrated data, and randomization of communication intervals\u2014all attempts to stay under the radar during intrusions.\n\nFor C&C servers, Longhorn typically configures a specific domain and IP address combination per target. The domains appear to be registered by the attackers; however they use privacy services to hide their real identity. The IP addresses are typically owned by legitimate companies offering virtual private server (VPS) or webhosting services. The malware communicates with C&C servers over HTTPS using a custom underlying cryptographic protocol to protect communications from identification.",

            "description": "A subgroup of the {{CIA}}.\n\n(ClearSky) Over the last few weeks, several significant leaks regarding a number of Iranian APTs took place. After analyzing and investigating the documents we conclude that they are authentic. Consequently, this causes considerable harm to the groups and their operation. The identity of the actor behind the leak is currently unknown, however based on the scope and the quality of the exposed documents and information, it appears that they are professional and highly capable. This leak will likely hamstring the groups\u2019 operation in the near future. Accordingly, in our assessment this will minimize the risk of potential attacks in the next few months and possibly even year. Note \u2013most of the leaks are posted on Telegram channels that were created specifically for this purpose.\n\nBelow are the three main Telegram groups on which the leaks were posted:\n\u2022 Lab Dookhtegam pseudonym (\u201cThe people whose lips are stitched and sealed\u201d \u2013translation from Persian) \u2013In this channel attack tools attributed to the group \u2018{{OilRig, APT 34, Helix Kitten, Chrysene}}\u2019 were leaked; including a webshell that was inserted into the Technion, various tools that were used for DNS attacks, and more.\n\u2022 Green Leakers\u2013In this channel attack tools attributed to the group \u2018{{MuddyWater, Seedworm, TEMP.Zagros, Static Kitten}}\u2019 were leaked. The group\u2019s name and its symbol are identified with the \u201cgreen movement\u201d, which led the protests in Iran after the Presidential elections in 2009. These protests were heavily repressed by the revolutionary guards (IRGC)\n\u2022 Black Box\u2013Unlike the previous two channels this has been around for a long time. On Friday May 5th, dozens of confidential documents labeled as \u201csecret\u201d (a high confidentiality level in Iran, one before the highest \u2013top secret) were posted on this channel.

The emails are sent to technology and security personnel working in departments including Fraud and Information Security.\nhttps://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/microsoft-word-intruder-integrates-cve-2017-0199-utilized-cobalt-group-target\r\n**2017-08**: The first spam run on August 31 used a Rich Text Format (RTF) document laden with malicious macros. The second, which ran from September 20 to 21, used an exploit for CVE-2017-8759 (patched last September), a code injection/remote code execution vulnerability in Microsoft\u2019s .NET Framework. The vulnerability was used to retrieve and execute Cobalt Strike from a remote server they controlled.\nhttps://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/cobalt-spam-runs-use-macros-cve-2017-8759-exploit/\r\n**2017-11**: On Tuesday, November 21, a massive spear-phishing campaign began targeting individual employees at various financial institutions, mostly in Russia and Turkey. Purporting to provide info on changes to \u2018SWIFT\u2019 terms, the email contained a single attachment with no text in the body. It was an attempt by the Cobalt Group to gain a foothold in the networks of the targeted individuals\u2019 organizations\nhttps://www.riskiq.com/blog/labs/cobalt-strike/\r\n**2018-01**: Spear-phishing attacks to Russian banks\nThe emails were sent in the name of a large European bank in an attempt to social engineer the receiver into trusting the email. The emails were quite plain with only a single question in the body and an attachment with the name once.rtf. In other cases, we saw a file with the name \u0417\u0430\u044f\u0432\u043b\u0435\u043d\u0438\u0435.rtf attached to an email that was also written in Russian.\nhttps://www.riskiq.com/blog/labs/cobalt-group-spear-phishing-russian-banks/\r\n**2018-05**: On May 23, 1:21 p.m (Moscow time) Group-IB tracked a new large-scale Cobalt cyberattack on the leading banks of Russia and the CIS. It was like a challenge: phishing emails were sent acting as a major anti-virus vendor. Bank employees received a \u201ccomplaint\u201d, in English, that their computers allegedly violated legislation.\nhttps://www.group-ib.com/blog/renaissance\r\n**2018-09**: In 2018, CTU researchers observed several GOLD KINGSWOOD campaigns involving SpicyOmelette, a tool used by the group during initial exploitation of an organization. This sophisticated JavaScript remote access tool is generally delivered via phishing, and it uses multiple defense evasion techniques to hinder prevention and detection activities.\nhttps://www.secureworks.com/blog/cybercriminals-increasingly-trying-to-ensnare-the-big-financial-fish\r\n**2018-10**: One of the latest examples related to the campaign under analysis was used in attacks just a few days ago. It shows the simplicity of the attack delivery employed by this group.\nThe attack reinforces the fact that email is still one of the primary attack vectors we continuously observe. This attack begins by targeting employees at several banking entities across the globe using an email with subject \u201cConfirmations on October 16, 2018\u201d.\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-new-techniques-uncover-attribute-cobalt-gang-commodity-builders-infrastructure-revealed/\r\n**2019-10**: Magecart Group 4: A link with Cobalt Group?\nhttps://blog.malwarebytes.com/threat-analysis/2019/10/magecart-group-4-a-link-with-cobalt-group/\r\n",

We stumbled upon Confucius, likely from South Asia, while delving into Patchwork\u2019s cyberespionage operations.\n\nConfucius\u2019 operations include deploying bespoke backdoors and stealing files from their victim\u2019s systems with tailored file stealers. The stolen files are then exfiltrated by abusing a cloud service provider. Some of these file stealers specifically target files from USB devices, probably to overcome air-gapped environments.\n\nThis group seems to be associated with {{Patchwork, Dropping Elephant}}.",

InPage is a word processor program that supports languages such as Urdu, Persian, Pashto, and Arabic. The three InPage exploit files are linked through their use of very similar shellcode, which suggests that either the same actor is behind these attacks, or the attackers have access to a shared builder.\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-recent-inpage-exploits-lead-multiple-malware-families/\r\n**2017 Late**: Probing Confucius\u2019 infrastructure, we came across websites offering Windows and Android chat applications, most likely iterations of its predecessor, Simple Chat Point: Secret Chat Point, and Tweety Chat. We are admittedly uncertain of the extent \u2014 and success \u2014 of their use, but it\u2019s one of the ingredients of the group\u2019s operations.\nhttps://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/deciphering-confucius-cyberespionage-operations/\r\n**2018-05**: During their previous campaign, we found Confucius using fake romance websites to entice victims into installing malicious Android applications.

The attack itself lasted only 14 minutes, however, it managed to cause a high volatility in the exchange rate of between 55/62 (Buy/Sell) rubles per 1 dollar instead of the 60-62 stable range.\n\nTo conduct the attack criminals used the Corkow malware, also known as Metel, containing specific modules designed to conduct thefts from trading systems, such as QUIK operated by ARQA Technologies and TRANSAQ from ZAO \u201cScreen market systems\u201d. Corkow provided remote access to the ITS-Broker system terminal by \u00abPlatforma soft\u00bb Ltd., which enabled the fraud to be committed.\n\nIn August 2015 a new incident related to the Corkow (Metel) Trojan was detected. An attack on a bank card systems, which included about 250 banks which used the bank card system to service cash withdrawals from Visa and MasterCard cards under a special tariff. This attack resulted in the hundreds of millions of rubles being stolen via ATMs of the systems members.",

The campaign, dubbed CostaRicto by BlackBerry, appears to be operated by \u201chackers-for-hire\u201d, a group of APT mercenaries who possess bespoke malware tooling and complex VPN proxy and SSH tunnelling capabilities.\nMercenary groups offering APT-style attacks are becoming more and more popular. Their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) often resemble highly sophisticated state-sponsored campaigns, but the profiles and geography of their victims are far too diverse to be aligned with a single bad actor\u2019s interests.\nAlthough in theory the customers of a mercenary APT might include anyone who can afford it, the more sophisticated actors will naturally choose to work with patrons of the highest profile \u2013 be it large organizations, influential individuals, or even governments. Having a lot at stake, the cybercriminals must choose very carefully when selecting their commissions to avoid the risk of being exposed.",

Covellite lacks an industrial control system (ICS) specific capability at this time.\n\nCovellite operates globally with targets primarily in Europe, East Asia, and North America. US targets emerged in September 2017 with a small, targeted phishing campaign directed at select U.S. electric companies. The phishing emails contained a malicious Microsoft Word document and infected computers with malware.\n\nThe malicious emails discovered in the fall masqueraded as resumes or invitations. They delivered a remote access tool (RAT) payload which was used to conduct reconnaissance and enable persistent, covert access to victims\u2019 machines.\n\nCovellite\u2019s infrastructure and malware are similar to the hacking organization known as {{Lazarus Group, Hidden Cobra, Labyrinth Chollima}} by Novetta and Hidden Cobra by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.\n\nLazarus Group is responsible for attacks ranging from the 2014 attack on Sony Pictures to a number of Bitcoin heists in 2017. Technical analysis of Covellite malware indicates an evolution from known Lazarus toolkits. However, aside from technical overlap, it is not known how the capabilities and operations between Covellite and Lazarus are related.\n\nCovellite remains active but appears to have abandoned North American targets, with indications of activity in Europe and East Asia. Given the group\u2019s specific interest in infrastructure operations, rapidly improving capabilities, and history of aggressive targeting, Dragos considers this group a primary threat to the ICS industry.",

Appropriating the Ukrainian special police force name and logo, the group has aligned itself as pro-Russian, anti-Ukrainian, and most recently attacked Western intervention efforts in the Ukrainian conflict. While the group has taken Ukrainian identities, technical links and contextual analysis connect the group to Russia.\n\nThe group began with successful distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks on multiple NATO websites just as separatists in the physical world were beginning to storm military buildings. Since their initial attacks the group has continued to take down websites, and most recently leaked confidential documents between US billionaire George Soros and the Ukrainian prime minister and president which contained plans for Western intervention.",

The attackers were resourceful and kept updating their malware during the full lifecycle of their operations, so the observed samples from 2017 are totally different from the initial samples from 2009. The suspension of its operations may be related to the publishing of the \u2018Lost in Translation\u2019 leak, or the attackers may simply have decided to switch to more modern approaches and start using more widely available artefacts for their operations.",

The attack compromised their devices and exfiltrated data to the attackers\u2019 command and control server. In addition, the compromised devices were pushed Trojan updates, which allowed the attackers to extend their capabilities. The operation remains active at the time of writing this post, with attacks reported as recently as February 2017.\nhttps://securelist.com/breaking-the-weakest-link-of-the-strongest-chain/77562/\r\n**2017-04**: ThreatConnect has identified a KASPERAGENT malware campaign leveraging decoy Palestinian Authority documents.

We believe that this is a new variant of VAMP, indicating that the threat actors behind APT-C-23 are still active and continuously improving their product. Some C&C domains from VAMP were reused in newer GnatSpy variants, indicating that these attacks are connected. We detect this new family as ANDROIDOS_GNATSPY.\nhttps://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/new-gnatspy-mobile-malware-family-discovered/\r\n**2018 Early**: Lookout researchers have identified a new, highly targeted surveillanceware family known as Desert Scorpion in the Google Play Store.

The theme may allow the network traffic to fly under the radar.\n\nThe actors use false personas to register their domains instead of opting for privacy protection services.  Depending on the registrar service chosen, this could be seen as another cost control measure.  The actors often used typo-squatting to slightly alter a legitimate domain name. In contrast, the registration information used accurate spelling, possibly indicating the domain naming was intentional, typos included. Each unique registrant usually registered only a few domains, but mistakenly reused phone numbers or the registration data portrayed a similar pattern across domains.",

This new variant was behind a series of ransomware campaigns beginning in June 2019, including attacks against the City of Edcouch, Texas and the Chilean Ministry of Agriculture.\n\nWe have dubbed this new ransomware DoppelPaymer because it shares most of its code with the BitPaymer ransomware operated by {{Indrik Spider}}. However, there are a number of differences between DoppelPaymer and BitPaymer, which may signify that one or more members of Indrik Spider have split from the group and forked the source code of both Dridex and BitPaymer to start their own Big Game Hunting ransomware operation.\n\nDoppelPaymer has been observed to be distributed by Smoke Loader (operated by {{Smoky Spider}}) and Emotet (operated by {{Mummy Spider, TA542}}).",

We also started monitoring the malware and, using Kaspersky Attribution Engine based on similarity algorithms, discovered that Octopus is related to DustSquad, something we reported in April 2018.

This may be explained by the group\u2019s early reliance on Dynamic DNS domains for their command and control (C2) infrastructure, as well as their use of public RATs like Poison Ivy and Gh0st RAT for second-stage implants.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until June 2011 that Operation Dust Storm started to garner some notoriety from a series of attacks which leveraged an unpatched Internet Explorer 8 vulnerability, CVE-2011-1255, to gain a foothold into victim networks. In these attacks, a link to the exploit was sent via a spear phishing email from a purported Chinese student seeking advice or asking the target a question following a presentation.\n\nAs to other documented cases, the attacker started interacting with the infected machine within minutes of compromise to begin manual network and host enumeration.\n\nIn October 2011, the group attempted to take advantage of the ongoing Libyan crisis at the time and phish the news cycle regarding Muammar Gaddafi\u2019s death on October 20, 2011. It appears that in addition to some US defense targets, this campaign was also directed at a Uyghur mailing list.

While a thorough post-mortem of the Bank of Valletta attack has yet to be made public, it is highly likely that the threat actors sent malicious spear phishing emails to employees at Bank of Valletta and other European financial institutions. In October 2018, HSBC Malta reported receiving phishing emails that bore hallmarks of the subsequent EmpireMonkey attack against Bank of Valletta.\n\nThis group seems to be directly related to {{Carbanak, Anunak}} and/or {{FIN7}}.",

            "operations": "**2013-02**: Spam campaign\nThe Dragonfly group has used at least three infection tactics against targets in the energy sector. The earliest method was an email spear phishing campaign, which saw selected executives and senior employees in target companies receive emails containing a malicious PDF attachment. Infected emails had one of two subject lines: \u201cThe account\u201d or \u201cSettlement of delivery problem\u201d.\nhttps://www.symantec.com/content/en/us/enterprise/media/security_response/whitepapers/Dragonfly_Threat_Against_Western_Energy_Suppliers.pdf\r\n**2013-06**: Watering Hole Attacks using Lightsout\nIn June 2013, the attackers shifted their focus to watering hole attacks. They compromised a number of energy-related websites and injected an iframe into each of them. This iframe then redirected visitors to another compromised legitimate website hosting the Lightsout exploit kit. This in turn exploited either Java or Internet Explorer in order to drop Oldrea or Karagany on the victim\u2019s computer.\r\n**2013-09**: Watering Hole Attacks using Hello\nIn September 2013, Dragonfly began using a new version of this exploit kit, known as the Hello exploit kit. The landing page for this kit contains JavaScript which fingerprints the system, identifying installed browser plugins. The victim is then redirected to a URL which in turn determines the best exploit to use based on the information collected.\r\n**2013**: Trojanized software\nThe most ambitious attack vector used by Dragonfly was the compromise of a number of legitimate software packages. Three different ICS equipment providers were targeted and malware was inserted into the software bundles they had made available for download on their websites.\r\n**2014-02**: LightsOut EK Targets Energy Sector\nLate last year, the story broke that threat actors were targeting the energy sector with Remote Access Tools and Intelligence gathering malware.  It would seem that the attackers responsible for this threat are back for more.  This particular APT struck late February between 2/24-2/26.\nhttps://www.zscaler.com/blogs/research/lightsout-ek-targets-energy-sector\r\n**2015-12**: Attack on Energy Companies in the Ukraine\nAccording to a statement posted this week on the official website of the Ukrainian security service SBU, Russian special services allegedly planted malware on the networks of several regional power companies. The malicious software is said to have been discovered by employees of the SBU.\nThe SBU said the attackers also flooded the targeted companies\u2019 technical support phone lines. The agency removed the malware and launched an investigation.\nJust before Christmas, power outages were reported in the Ivano-Frankivsk Oblast region of Ukraine.

            "description": "(Ars Technica) Kaspersky researchers have documented 500 infections by Equation Group in at least 42 countries, with Iran, Russia, Pakistan, Afghanistan, India, Syria, and Mali topping the list. Because of a self-destruct mechanism built into the malware, the researchers suspect that this is just a tiny percentage of the total; the actual number of victims likely reaches into the tens of thousands.\n\nA long list of almost superhuman technical feats illustrate Equation Group\u2019s extraordinary skill, painstaking work, and unlimited resources. They include:\n\u2022 The use of virtual file systems, a feature also found in the highly sophisticated Regin malware. Recently published documents provided by Ed Snowden indicate that the NSA used Regin to infect the partly state-owned Belgian firm Belgacom.\n\u2022 The stashing of malicious files in multiple branches of an infected computer\u2019s registry. By encrypting all malicious files and storing them in multiple branches of a computer\u2019s Windows registry, the infection was impossible to detect using antivirus software.\n\u2022 Redirects that sent iPhone users to unique exploit Web pages. In addition, infected machines reporting to Equation Group command servers identified themselves as Macs, an indication that the group successfully compromised both iOS and OS X devices.\n\u2022 The use of more than 300 Internet domains and 100 servers to host a sprawling command and control infrastructure.\n\u2022 USB stick-based reconnaissance malware to map air-gapped networks, which are so sensitive that they aren\u2019t connected to the Internet. Both Stuxnet and the related Flame malware platform also had the ability to bridge airgaps.\n\u2022 An unusual if not truly novel way of bypassing code-signing restrictions in modern versions of Windows, which require that all third-party software interfacing with the operating system kernel be digitally signed by a recognized certificate authority. To circumvent this restriction, Equation Group malware exploited a known vulnerability in an already signed driver for CloneCD to achieve kernel-level code execution.\n\nTaken together, the accomplishments led Kaspersky researchers to conclude that Equation Group is probably the most sophisticated computer attack group in the world, with technical skill and resources that rival the groups that developed Stuxnet and the Flame espionage malware in {{Operation Olympic Games}}.\n\nOther publicly exposed major APT activities from the NSA involve the wholesale worldwide spying from programs such as PRISM and, together with {{GCHQ}}, INCENSER, where various international Internet trunks were tapped.",

            "description": "(Kaspersky) Ferocious Kitten is an APT group that has been active against Persian-speaking individuals since 2015 and appears to be based in Iran. Although it has been active over a large timespan, the group has mostly operated under the radar and, to the best of our knowledge, has not been covered by security researchers. It only recently attracted attention when a lure document was uploaded to VirusTotal and was brought to public knowledge by researchers on Twitter. Subsequently, one of its implants was analyzed by a Chinese intelligence firm. We have been able to expand some of the findings on the group and provide insights on additional variants. The malware dropped from the aforementioned document is dubbed MarkiRAT and is used to record keystrokes and clipboard content, provide file download and upload capabilities as well as the ability to execute arbitrary commands on the victim\u2019s machine. We were able to trace the implant back to at least 2015, along with variants intended to hijack the execution of the Telegram and Chrome applications as a persistence method. Interestingly, some of the TTPs used by this threat actor are reminiscent of other groups operating in the domain of dissident surveillance. For example, it used the same C2 domains across its implants for years, which was witnessed in the activity of {{Domestic Kitten}}. In the same vein, the Telegram execution hijacking technique observed in this campaign by Ferocious Kitten was also observed being used by {{Rampant Kitten}}, as covered by Check Point. In our private report, we expand the details on these findings as well as provide analysis and mechanics of the MarkiRAT malware.",

No spear-phishing, either: The cybercriminal group tied to numerous payment card breaches including Goodwill and best known by its so-called \u201cRawPOS\u201d malware employed legitimate user credentials to access its targets\u2019 networks.\n\nResearchers at FireEye here today shared their recent findings on this prolific and long-running cybercrime gang that has been the subject of multiple Visa security alerts to merchants. The RawPOS memory scraper malware has been infecting the lodging industry in epidemic proportions over the past year, and is considered one of the first memory scrapers to target point-of-sale systems.\n\nFireEye has dubbed the cybercrime gang FIN5. \u201cOne of the most unique things about FIN5 is that in every intrusion we responded to where FIN5 has been active, legitimate access was identified. They had valid user credentials to remotely log into the network,\u201d said Barry Vengerik, principal threat analyst at FireEye. \u201cNo sexy zero-days, no remote exploits \u2013 not even spear-phishing. They had credentials from somewhere.\u201d\n\nFIN5, which earlier this year was profiled by researchers at Trend Micro and has been in action since at least 2008, uses real credentials from the victim organization\u2019s virtual private network, Remote Desktop Protocol, Citrix, or VNC. Vengerik says the attackers got those credentials via third parties associated with the victims\u2019 POS systems.",

FIN7 has moved away from weaponized Microsoft Office macros in order to evade detection. This round of FIN7 phishing lures implements hidden shortcut files (LNK files) to initiate the infection and VBScript functionality launched by mshta.exe to infect the victim.\nhttps://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/04/fin7-phishing-lnk.html\r\n**2017-07**: Proofpoint researchers have uncovered that the threat actor commonly referred to as FIN7 has added a new Jscript backdoor called Bateleur and updated macros to its toolkit.\nhttps://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/fin7carbanak-threat-actor-unleashes-bateleur-jscript-backdoor\r\n**2017**: Leveraging Shim Databases for Persistence\nA unique aspect of the incidents was how the group installed the CARBANAK backdoor for persistent access. Mandiant identified that the group leveraged an application shim database to achieve persistence on systems in multiple environments. The shim injected a malicious in-memory patch into the Services Control Manager (\u201cservices.exe\u201d) process, and then spawned a CARBANAK backdoor process.\nhttps://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2017/05/fin7-shim-databases-persistence.html\r\n**2017-06**: Highly sophisticated fileless attack targeting restaurants across the US\nOn June 7, 2017, Morphisec Lab identified a new, highly sophisticated fileless attack targeting restaurants across the US. The ongoing campaign allows hackers to seize system control and install a backdoor to steal financial information at will. It incorporates some never before seen evasive techniques that allow it to bypass most security solutions \u2013 signature and behavior based.\nhttp://blog.morphisec.com/fin7-attacks-restaurant-industry\r\n**2017-10**: Attack to target banks and the enterprise\nLike clockwork, FIN7 again unleashed a new attack able to bypass almost every security solution. The attack, which took place between October 8 to 10, 2017, is yet another demonstration of the high-paced innovation by threat actors.\nhttp://blog.morphisec.com/fin7-attack-modifications-revealed\r\n**2018-05**: New Attack Panel and Malware Samples\nFlashpoint analysts recently uncovered a new attack panel used by this group in campaigns they have called Astra. The panel, written in PHP, functions as a script-management system, pushing attack scripts down to compromised computers.\nhttps://www.flashpoint-intel.com/blog/fin7-revisited-inside-astra-panel-and-sqlrat-malware/\r\n**2018**: High-profile breaches including Red Robin, Chili\u2019s, Arby\u2019s, Burgerville, Omni Hotels and Saks Fifth Avenue, among many others.\nFifth Avenue, Saks Off 5th, and Lord & Taylor department stores\u2014all owned by The Hudson\u2019s Bay Company\u2014acknowledged a data breach impacting more than five million credit and debit card numbers. The culprits? The same group that\u2019s spent the last few years pulling off data heists from Omni Hotels & Resorts, Trump Hotels, Jason\u2019s Deli, Whole Foods, Chipotle: A mysterious group known as Fin7.\nhttp://blog.morphisec.com/fin7-not-finished-morphisec-spots-new-campaign\r\n**2018-11**: In this blog post, we present our findings on two campaigns, which occurred in the first and second weeks of November. These campaigns follow patterns similar to those presented by FireEye in August but with just enough variations to bypass many security vendors.\nhttp://blog.morphisec.com/fin7-not-finished-morphisec-spots-new-campaign\r\n**2018/2019**: In 2018-2019, researchers of Kaspersky Lab\u2019s Global Research and Analysis Team analyzed various campaigns that used the same Tactics Tools and Procedures (TTPs) as the historic FIN7, leading the researchers to believe that this threat actor had remained active despite the 2018 arrests. In addition, during the investigation, we discovered certain similarities to other attacker groups that seemed to share or copy the FIN7 TTPs in their own operations.\nhttps://securelist.com/fin7-5-the-infamous-cybercrime-rig-fin7-continues-its-activities/90703/\r\n**2019-01**: The shared codebase with recent tools attributed to FIN7, together with the same techniques and backdoor, allows to attribute this new loader to the cybercrime group. The timestamps, together with simpler functionality, suggest BIOLOAD is a preceding iteration of BOOSTWRITE.\nSince the loader is specifically built for each targeted machine and requires administrative permissions to deploy, it suggests the group gathers information about its targets\u2019 networks.\nhttps://www.fortinet.com/blog/threat-research/bioload-fin7-boostwrite-lost-twin.html\r\n**2019-10**: In this blog, we reveal two of FIN7\u2019s new tools that we have called BOOSTWRITE and RDFSNIFFER.\nhttps://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2019/10/mahalo-fin7-responding-to-new-tools-and-techniques.html\r\n**2020-03**: A US hospitality provider has recently been the target of an incredibly rare BadUSB attack, ZDNet has learned from cyber-security firm Trustwave.\nThe attack happened after the company received an envelope containing a fake BestBuy gift card, along with a USB thumb drive.\nhttps://www.zdnet.com/article/rare-badusb-attack-detected-in-the-wild-against-us-hospitality-provider/\r\n**2020-07**: Collaboration between FIN7 and the RYUK group\nhttps://blog.truesec.com/2020/12/22/collaboration-between-fin7-and-the-ryuk-group-a-truesec-investigation/\r\n**2020-12**: This report presents an attack chain that was intercepted and prevented within a customer\u2019s network in December 2020, then will focus on a component from a typical FIN7 attack chain - JSSLoader.\nhttps://blog.morphisec.com/the-evolution-of-the-fin7-jssloader\r\n",

In the past year, not only have we observed this group using similar infrastructure and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), but they are also the only group we have observed to date who uses the downloader PUNCHBUGGY and POS malware PUNCHTRACK. Designed to scrape both Track 1 and Track 2 payment card data, PUNCHTRACK is loaded and executed by a highly obfuscated launcher and is never saved to disk.\n\nThis actor has conducted operations on a large scale and at a rapid pace, displaying a level of operational awareness and ability to adapt their operations on the fly. These abilities, combined with targeted usage of an EoP exploit and the reconnaissance required to individually tailor phishing emails to victims, potentially speaks to the threat actors\u2019 operational maturity and sophistication.\n\nFireEye identified more than 100 organizations in North America that fell victim to this campaign.",

In some cases, when the extortion demand was not met, the attacker(s) destroyed production Windows systems by deleting critical operating system files and then shutting down the impacted systems. Based on near parallel TTPs used by the attacker(s) across these targeted intrusions, we believe these clusters of activity are linked to a single, previously unobserved actor or group that we have dubbed FIN10.",

            "description": "(FireEye) Mandiant has also responded to numerous FIN11 intrusions, but we\u2019ve only observed the group successfully monetize access in few instances. This could suggest that the actors cast a wide net during their phishing operations, then choose which victims to further exploit based on characteristics such as sector, geolocation or perceived security posture. Recently, FIN11 has deployed CLOP ransomware and threatened to publish exfiltrated data to pressure victims into paying ransom demands. The group\u2019s shifting monetization methods\u2014from point-of-sale (POS) malware in 2018, to ransomware in 2019, and hybrid extortion in 2020\u2014is part of a larger trend in which criminal actors have increasingly focused on post-compromise ransomware deployment and data theft extortion.\n\nNotably, FIN11 includes a subset of the activity security researchers call {{TA505, Graceful Spider, Gold Evergreen}}, but we do not attribute TA505\u2019s early operations to FIN11 and caution against using the names interchangeably. Attribution of both historic TA505 activity and more recent FIN11 activity is complicated by the actors\u2019 use of criminal service providers. Like most financially motivated actors, FIN11 doesn\u2019t operate in a vacuum. We believe that the group has used services that provide anonymous domain registration, bulletproof hosting, code signing certificates, and private or semi-private malware. Outsourcing work to these criminal service providers likely enables FIN11 to increase the scale and sophistication of their operations.",

            "description": "(Lookingglass) The Lookingglass Cyber Threat Intelligence Group (CTIG) has been tracking an ongoing cyber espionage campaign named \u201cOperation Armageddon\u201d. The name was derived from multiple Microsoft Word documents used in the attacks. \u201cArmagedon\u201d (spelled incorrectly) was found in the \u201cLast Saved By\u201d and \u201cAuthor\u201d fields in multiple Microsoft Word documents. Although continuously developed, the campaign has been intermittently active at a small scale, and uses unsophisticated techniques. The attack timing suggests the campaign initially started due to Ukraine\u2019s decision to accept the Ukraine-\u00ad\u2010European Union Association Agreement (AA). The agreement was designed to improve economic integrations between Ukraine and the European Union. Russian leaders publicly stated that they believed this move by Ukraine directly threatened Russia\u2019s national security. Although initial steps to join the Association occurred in March 2012, the campaign didn\u2019t start until much later (mid\u20102013), as Ukraine and the EU started to more actively move towards the agreement.\n\nRussian actors began preparing for attacks in case Ukraine finalized the AA. The earliest identified modification timestamp of malware used in this campaign is June 26, 2013. A group of files with modification timestamps between August 12 and September 16, 2013 were used in the first wave of spear-phishing attacks, targeting government officials prior to the 10th Yalta Annual Meeting: \u201cChanging Ukraine in a Changing World: Factors of Success.\u201d",

Upon opening the RAR archive, an executable is started instead of a Microsoft Word document, resulting in infection.\n\nOnce inside the network, the GCMAN group uses legitimate and penetration testing tools such as Putty, VNC, and Meterpreter for lateral movement. Our investigation revealed an attack where the group then planted a cron script into bank\u2019s server, sending financial transactions at the rate of $200 per minute. A time-based scheduler was invoking the script every minute to post new transactions directly to upstream payment processing system. This allowed the group to transfer money to multiple e-currency services without these transactions being reported to any system inside the bank.",

In this second report from the Information Warfare Monitor, we lay out the findings of a 10-month investigation of alleged Chinese cyber spying against Tibetan institutions.  The investigation, consisting of fieldwork, technical scouting, and laboratory analysis, discovered a lot more. The investigation ultimately uncovered a network of over 1,295 infected hosts in 103 countries. Up to 30% of the infected hosts are considered high-value targets and include computers located at ministries of foreign affairs, embassies, international organizations, news media, and NGOs. The Tibetan computer systems we manually investigated, and from which our investigations began, were conclusively compromised by multiple infections that gave attackers unprecedented access to potentially sensitive information.\n\n(UCAM) Attacks on the Dalai Lama\u2019s Private Office\nThe OHHDL started to suspect it was under surveillance while setting up meetings be-tween His Holiness and foreign dignitaries. They sent an email invitation on behalf of His Holiness to a foreign diplomat, but before they could follow it up with a courtesy telephone call, the diplomat\u2019s office was contacted by the Chinese government and warned not to go ahead with the meeting. The Tibetans wondered whether a computer compromise might be the explanation; they called ONI Asia who called us. (Until May 2008, the first author was employed on a studentship funded by the OpenNet Initiative and the second author was a principal investigator for ONI.)\n\nAlso see {{Shadow Network}}.",

            "description": "(Kaspersky) In March 2018 we published our research on Olympic Destroyer, an advanced attack that hit organizers, suppliers and partners of the Winter Olympic Games 2018 held in Pyeongchang, South Korea. Olympic Destroyer was a cyber-sabotage attack based on the spread of a destructive network worm. The sabotage stage was preceded by reconnaissance and infiltration into target networks to select the best launchpad for the self-replicating and self-modifying destructive malware.\n\nWe are calling the actor behind the Olympic Destroyer attack \u2013 \u201cHades\u201d. We have previously emphasized that Hades is different from other threat actors because the whole attack was a masterful operation in deception. Despite that, the attackers made serious mistakes, which helped us to spot and prove the forgery of rare attribution artefacts. The attackers behind Olympic Destroyer forged automatically generated signatures, known as Rich Header, to make it look like the malware was produced by {{Lazarus Group, Hidden Cobra, Labyrinth Chollima}} APT, an actor widely believed to be associated with North Korea. If this is new to the reader, we recommend a separate blog dedicated to the analysis of this forgery.\n\nSome of the TTPs and operational security used by Hades during the Olympic Destroyer attack bear a certain resemblance to {{Sofacy, APT 28, Fancy Bear, Sednit}} APT group activity. When it comes to false flags, mimicking TTPs is much harder than tampering with technical artefacts. It implies a deep knowledge of how the actor being mimicked operates as well as operational adaptation to these new TTPs. However, it is important to remember that Hades can be considered a master in the use of false flags: for now we assess that connection with low to moderate confidence.",

The determination of this China-based adversary is truly impressive: they are like a dog with a bone.\n\nHurricane Panda\u2019s preferred initial vector of compromise and persistence is a China Chopper webshell \u2013 a tiny and easily obfuscated 70 byte text file that consists of an \u2018eval()\u2019 command, which is then used to provide full command execution and file upload/download capabilities to the attackers. This script is typically uploaded to a web server via a SQL injection or WebDAV vulnerability, which is often trivial to uncover in a company with a large external web presence.\n\nOnce inside, the adversary immediately moves on to execution of a credential theft tool such as Mimikatz (repacked to avoid AV detection). If they are lucky to have caught an administrator who might be logged into that web server at the time, they will have gained domain administrator credentials and can now roam your network at will via \u2018net use\u2019 and \u2018wmic\u2019 commands executed through the webshell terminal.",

Targets include individuals in strategic positions: Executives in important businesses such as oil, finance and engineering, military officers, embassy personnel and government officials. The Inception attacks began by focusing on targets primarily located in Russia or related to Russian interests, but have since spread to targets in other locations around the world.  The preferred malware delivery method is via phishing emails containing trojanized documents.\n\n\u2022 Initially targeted at Russia, but expanding globally\n\u2022 Masterful identity cloaking and diversionary tactics\n\u2022 Clean and elegant code suggesting strong backing and top-tier talent\n\u2022 Includes malware targeting mobile devices: Android, Blackberry and iOS\n\u2022 Using a free cloud hosting service based in Sweden for command and control",

In 2015 and 2016, Dridex was one of the most prolific eCrime banking  rojans on the market and, since 2014, those efforts are thought to have netted Indrik Spider millions of dollars in criminal profits. Throughout its years of operation, Dridex has received multiple updates with new modules developed and new anti-analysis features added to the malware.\n\nIn August 2017, a new ransomware variant identified as BitPaymer was reported to have ransomed the U.K.\u2019s National Health Service (NHS), with a high ransom demand of 53 BTC (approximately $200,000 USD). The targeting of an organization rather than individuals, and the high ransom demands, made BitPaymer stand out from other contemporary ransomware at the time. Though the encryption and ransom functionality of BitPaymer was not technically sophisticated, the malware contained multiple anti-analysis features that overlapped with Dridex. Later technical analysis of BitPaymer indicated that it had been developed by Indrik Spider, suggesting the group had expanded its criminal operation to include ransomware as a monetization strategy.\n\nIndrik Spider appears to be a subgroup of {{TA505, Graceful Spider, Gold Evergreen}}. In 2019, a subgroup of Indrik Spider split off into {{Doppel Spider}}.\n\nDridex has been observed to be distributed via Necurs (operated by {{Monty Spider}}) and Emotet (operated by {{Mummy Spider, TA542}}).",

In line5with other research on the campaign, released prior to publication of this document, we have adopted the name \u201cInfy\u201d, which is based on labels used in the infrastructure and its two families of malware agents.\n\nThanks to information we have been able to collect during the course of our research, such as characteristics of the group\u2019s malware and development cycle, our research strongly supports the claim that the Infy group is of Iranian origin and potentially connected to the Iranian state. Amongst a backdrop of other incidents, Infy became one of the most frequently observed agents for attempted malware attacks against Iranian civil society beginning in late 2014, growing in use up to the February 2016 parliamentary election in Iran. After the conclusion of the parliamentary election, the rate of attempted intrusions and new compromises through the Infy agent slowed, but did not end. The trends witnessed in reports from recipients are reinforced through telemetry provided by design failures in more recent versions of the Infy malware.",

            "operations": "**2010**: Operation \u201cKe3chang\u201d\nAs the crisis in Syria escalates, FireEye research-ers have discovered a cyber espionage campaign, which we call \u201cKe3chang,\u201d that falsely advertises information updates about the ongoing crisis to compromise MFA networks in Europe. We believe that the Ke3chang attackers are operating out of China and have been active since at least 2010. However, we believe specific Syria-themed attacks against MFAs (codenamed by Ke3chang as \u201cmoviestar\u201d) began only in August 2013. The timing of the attacks precedes a G20 meeting held in Russia that focused on the crisis in Syria.\nhttps://www.fireeye.com/content/dam/fireeye-www/global/en/current-threats/pdfs/wp-operation-ke3chang.pdf\r\n**2014-08**: Forced to Adapt: XSLCmd Backdoor Now on OS X\nhttps://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2014/09/forced-to-adapt-xslcmd-backdoor-now-on-os-x.html\r\n**2015**: The Lookout Threat Intelligence team has discovered four Android surveillanceware tools, which are used to target the Uyghur ethnic minority group. Our research indicates that these four interconnected malware tools are elements of much larger mAPT (mobile advanced persistent threat) campaigns that have been active for years. Although there is evidence that the campaigns have been active since at least 2013, Lookout researchers have been monitoring the surveillanceware families \u2014 SilkBean, DoubleAgent, CarbonSteal and GoldenEagle \u2014 as far back as 2015.\nhttps://www.lookout.com/documents/threat-reports/us/lookout-uyghur-malware-tr-us.pdf\r\n**2016-05**: Little has been published on the threat actors responsible for Operation Ke3chang since the report was released more than two years ago. However, Unit 42 has recently discovered the actors have continued to evolve their custom malware arsenal. We\u2019ve discovered a new malware family we\u2019ve named TidePool. It has strong behavioral ties to Ke3chang and is being used in an ongoing attack campaign against Indian embassy personnel worldwide. This targeting is also consistent with previous attacker TTPs; Ke3chang historically targeted the Ministry of Affairs, and also conducted several prior campaigns against India.\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/operation-ke3chang-resurfaces-with-new-tidepool-malware/\r\n**2017-05**: Attack on a company that provides a range of services to UK Government\nA number of sensitive documents were stolen by the attackers during the incident and we believe APT15 was targeting information related to UK government departments and military technology.\nDuring our analysis of the compromise, we identified new backdoors that now appear to be part of APT15\u2019s toolset. The backdoor BS2005 \u2013 which has traditionally been used by the group \u2013 now appears alongside the additional backdoors RoyalCli and RoyalDNS.\nhttps://www.nccgroup.trust/uk/about-us/newsroom-and-events/blogs/2018/march/apt15-is-alive-and-strong-an-analysis-of-royalcli-and-royaldns/\r\n**2018-06**: Operation \u201cMirageFox\u201d\nThe malware involved in this recent campaign, MirageFox, looks to be an upgraded version of a tool, a RAT believed to originate in 2012, known as Mirage.\nhttps://www.intezer.com/miragefox-apt15-resurfaces-with-new-tools-based-on-old-ones/\r\n**2019-03**: The group continues to be active in 2019 \u2013 in March 2019, we detected a new Ketrican sample that has evolved from the 2018 Ketrican backdoor. It attacked the same targets as the backdoor from 2018.\nhttps://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/07/18/okrum-ke3chang-targets-diplomatic-missions/\r\n**2020-05**: In mid May, we identified three recently uploaded samples from VirusTotal that share code with older APT15 implants. We named this new family of samples, \u201cKetrum\u201d, due to the merger of features in the documented backdoor families \u201cKetrican\u201d and \u201cOkrum\u201d.\nhttps://www.intezer.com/blog/research/the-evolution-of-apt15s-codebase-2020/\r\n",

            "description": "(Malwarebytes) Lazarus Group is commonly believed to be run by the North Korean government, motivated primarily by financial gain as a method of circumventing long-standing sanctions against the regime. They first came to substantial media notice in 2013 with a series of coordinated attacks against an assortment of South Korean broadcasters and financial institutions using DarkSeoul, a wiper program that overwrites sections of the victims\u2019 master boot record.\n\nIn November 2014, a large scale breach of Sony Pictures was attributed to Lazarus. The attack was notable due to its substantial penetration across Sony networks, the extensive amount of data exfiltrated and leaked, as well of use of a wiper in a possible attempt to erase forensic evidence. Attribution on the attacks was largely hazy, but the FBI released a statement tying the Sony breach to the earlier DarkSeoul attack, and officially attributed both incidents to North Korea.\n\nFast forward to May 2017 with the widespread outbreak of WannaCry, a piece of ransomware that used an SMB exploit as an attack vector. Attribution to North Korea rested largely on code reuse between WannaCry and previous North Korean attacks, but this was considered to be thin grounds given the common practice of tool sharing between regional threat groups. Western intelligence agencies released official statements to the public reaffirming the attribution, and on September 6, 2018, the US Department of Justice charged a North Korean national with involvement in both WannaCry and the Sony breach.\n\nLazarus Group has 3 subgroups:\n1. {{Subgroup: Andariel, Silent Chollima}}\n2. {{Subgroup: BeagleBoyz}}\n3. {{Subgroup: Bluenoroff, APT 38, Stardust Chollima}}\n\nThe following groups may be associated with the Lazarus Group: {{Covellite}}, {{Reaper, APT 37, Ricochet Chollima, ScarCruft}} and {{Wassonite}}.",

            "description": "(US CERT) The BeagleBoyz, an element of the North Korean government\u2019s Reconnaissance General Bureau, have likely been active since at least 2014. As opposed to typical cybercrime, the group likely conducts well-planned, disciplined, and methodical cyber operations more akin to careful espionage activities. Their malicious cyber operations have netted hundreds of millions of U.S. dollars and are likely a major source of funding for the North Korean regime. The group has always used a calculated approach, which allows them to sharpen their tactics, techniques, and procedures while evading detection. Over time, their operations have become increasingly complex and destructive. The tools and implants employed by this group are consistently complex and demonstrate a strong focus on effectiveness and operational security.\n\nNorth Korea's intelligence apparatus controls a hacking team dedicated to robbing banks through remote internet access. To differentiate methods from other North Korean malicious cyber activity, the U.S. Government refers to this team as BeagleBoyz, who represent a subset of HIDDEN COBRA activity. The BeagleBoyz overlap to varying degrees with groups tracked by the cybersecurity industry as {{Lazarus Group, Hidden Cobra, Labyrinth Chollima}} and {{Subgroup: Bluenoroff, APT 38, Stardust Chollima}} and are responsible for the FASTCash ATM cash outs reported in October 2018, fraudulent abuse of compromised bank-operated SWIFT system endpoints since at least 2015, and lucrative cryptocurrency thefts. This illicit behavior has been identified by the United Nations (UN) DPRK Panel of Experts as evasion of UN Security Council resolutions, as it generates substantial revenue for North Korea. North Korea can use these funds for its UN-prohibited nuclear weapons and ballistic missile programs. Additionally, this activity poses significant operational risk to the Financial Services sector and erodes the integrity of the financial system.",

Lead also steals code-signing certificates to sign its malware in subsequent attacks.\n\nIn most cases, Lead\u2019s attacks do not feature any advanced exploit techniques. The group also does not make special effort to cultivate victims prior to an attack. Instead, the group often simply emails a Winnti installer to potential victims, relying on basic social engineering tactics to convince recipients to run the attached malware. In some other cases, Lead gains access to a target by brute-forcing remote access login credentials, performing SQL injection, or exploiting unpatched web servers, and then they copy the Winnti installer directly to compromised machines.",

            "description": "(Symantec) Symantec has uncovered the operations of a threat actor named Leafminer that is targeting a broad list of government organizations and business verticals in various regions in the Middle East since at least early 2017. The group tends to adapt publicly available techniques and tools for their attacks and experiments with published proof-of-concept exploits. Leafminer attempts to infiltrate target networks through various means of intrusion: watering hole websites, vulnerability scans of network services on the internet, and brute-force/dictionary login attempts. The actor\u2019s post-compromise toolkit suggests that the group is looking for email data, files, and database servers on compromised target systems.\n\n(Dragos) Analysis of Raspite tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) indicate the group has been active in some form since early- to mid-2017. Raspite targeting includes entities in the US, Middle East, Europe, and East Asia. Operations against electric utility organizations appear limited to the US at this time.\n\nRaspite leverages strategic website compromise to gain initial access to target networks. Raspite uses the same methodology as {{Berserk Bear, Dragonfly 2.0}} and {{Allanite}} in embedding a link to a resource to prompt an SMB connection, from which it harvests Windows credentials. The group then deploys install scripts for a malicious service to beacon back to Raspite \u2013controlled infrastructure, allowing the adversary to remotely access the victim machine.",

The campaign also targeted an email address possibly belonging to a freelance journalist based in Cambodia who covers Cambodian politics, human rights, and Chinese development. We believe both attacks used the same infrastructure as a reported campaign by Chinese threat actor TEMP.Periscope (also known as Leviathan), which targeted Cambodian entities in the run-up to their July 2018 elections. Crucially, TEMP.Periscope\u2019s interest in the U.K. engineering company they targeted dates back to attempted intrusions in May 2017.\nhttps://www.recordedfuture.com/chinese-threat-actor-tempperiscope/\r\n**2017**: The current campaign is a sharp escalation of detected activity since summer 2017. Like multiple other Chinese cyber espionage actors, TEMP.Periscope has recently re-emerged and has been observed conducting operations with a revised toolkit. Known targets of this group have been involved in the maritime industry, as well as engineering-focused entities, and include research institutes, academic organizations, and private firms in the United States.\nhttps://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2018/03/suspected-chinese-espionage-group-targeting-maritime-and-engineering-industries.html\r\n**2018-07**: Targeting Cambodia Ahead of July 2018 Elections\nFireEye has examined a range of TEMP.Periscope activity revealing extensive interest in Cambodia\u2019s politics, with active compromises of multiple Cambodian entities related to the country\u2019s electoral system. This includes compromises of Cambodian government entities charged with overseeing the elections, as well as the targeting of opposition figures. This campaign occurs in the run up to the country\u2019s July 29, 2018, general elections.\nhttps://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2018/07/chinese-espionage-group-targets-cambodia-ahead-of-elections.html\r\n**2020-01**: The Malaysian Computer Emergency Response Team, a government-backed organization, said it had \u201cobserved an increase in [the] number of artifacts and victims involving a campaign against Malaysian government officials.\u201d\nhttps://www.zdnet.com/article/malaysia-warns-of-chinese-hacking-campaign-targeting-government-projects/\r\n",

They appear not to have highly technical skills but a good social engineering and phishing tricks. The threat actors are not particularly sophisticated, but it is well-understood that such attacks don\u2019t need to be sophisticated in order to be effective.",

It is a case of the attackers obtaining a maximum return on their investment. The attack shows how an intelligent attacker does not need to be particularly technically skilled in order to steal the information they are after. The attack begins, as is often the case, with an email sent to the victim. A malicious document is attached to the email, which, when loaded, activates the malware.  The attackers use tailored emails to encourage the victim to open the email. For example, one email sent to an academic claimed to be a call for papers for a conference (CFP).\n\nThe vast majority of the victims were based in India, with some in Malaysia. The victim industry was mostly military research and also shipping based in the Arabian and South China seas. In some instances the attackers appeared to have a clear goal, whereby specific files were retrieved from certain compromised computers. In other cases, the attackers used more of a \u2018shotgun\u2019 like approach, copying every file from a computer. Military technologies were obviously the focus of one particular attack with what appeared to be source code stolen. 45 different attacker IP addresses were observed. Out of those, 43 were within the same IP address range based in Sichuan province, China. The remaining two were based in South Korea. The pattern of attacker connections implies that the IP addresses are being used as a VPN, probably in an attempt to render the attackers anonymous.\n\nThe attacks have been active from at least April 2011 up to February 2012. The attackers are intelligent and focused, employing the minimum amount of work necessary for the maximum gain. They do not use zero day exploits or complicated threats, instead they rely on effective social engineering and lax security measures on the part of the victims.",

            "description": "(Kaspersky) APT actors are known for the frequently targeted nature of their attacks. Typically, they will handpick a set of targets that in turn are handled with almost surgical precision, with infection vectors, malicious implants and payloads being tailored to the victims\u2019 identities or environment. It\u2019s not often we observe a large-scale attack conducted by actors fitting this profile, usually due to such attacks being noisy, and thus putting the underlying operation at risk of being compromised by security products or researchers.\n\nWe recently came across unusual APT activity that exhibits the latter trait \u2013 it was detected in high volumes, albeit most likely aimed at a few targets of interest. This large-scale and highly active campaign was observed in South East Asia and dates back to at least October 2020, with the most recent attacks seen around the time of writing. Most of the early sightings were in Myanmar, but it now appears the attackers are much more active in the Philippines, where there are more than 10 times as many known targets.\n\nFurther analysis revealed that the underlying actor, which we dubbed LuminousMoth, shows an affinity to the {{Mustang Panda, Bronze President}} (HoneyMyte) group. This is evident in both network infrastructure connections, and the usage of similar TTPs to deploy the Cobalt Strike Beacon as a payload. In fact, our colleagues at ESET and Avast recently assessed that HoneyMyte was active in the same region. The proximity in time and common occurrence in Myanmar of both campaigns could suggest that various TTPs of HoneyMyte may have been borrowed for the activity of LuminousMoth.",

            "description": "(Kaspersky) When we first encountered Lurk, in 2011, it was a nameless Trojan. It all started when we became aware of a number of incidents at several Russian banks that had resulted in the theft of large sums of money from customers. To steal the money, the unknown criminals used a hidden malicious program that was able to interact automatically with the financial institution\u2019s remote banking service (RBS) software; replacing bank details in payment orders generated by an accountant at the attacked organization, or even generating such orders by itself.\n\nIn 2016, it is hard to imagine banking software that does not demand some form of additional authentication, but things were different back in 2011. In most cases, the attackers only had to infect the computer on which the RBS software was installed in order to start stealing the cash. Russia\u2019s banking system, like those of many other countries, was unprepared for such attacks, and cybercriminals were quick to exploit the security gap.\n\nSo we decided to take a closer look at the malware. The first attempts to understand how the program worked gave our analysts nothing. Regardless of whether it was launched on a virtual or a real machine, it behaved in the same way: it didn\u2019t do anything. This is how the program, and later the group behind it, got its name. To \u201clurk\u201d means to hide, generally with the intention of ambush.\n\nWe were soon able to help investigate another incident involving Lurk. This time we got a chance to explore the image of the attacked computer. There, in addition to the familiar malicious program, we found a .dll file with which the main executable file could interact. This was our first piece of evidence that Lurk had a modular structure.\n\nLater discoveries suggest that, in 2011, Lurk was still at an early stage of development. It was formed of just two components, a number that would grow considerably over the coming years.",

We observed multiple instances of attacks involving this RAT, and all of them happened in Central Asia. Among the targeted subjects were several important companies in the telecommunications and gas industries, and governmental entities.\n\nMoreover, we connect the dots between the latest campaign and three previously published reports: Kaspersky\u2019s Microcin against Russian military personnel, Palo Alto Networks\u2019 BYEBY against the Belarussian government and Checkpoint\u2019s {{Vicious Panda}} against the Mongolian public sector. Also, we discuss other malware that was typically a part of the attacker\u2019s toolset together with the RAT. We chose the name Mikroceen to cover all instances of the RAT, in acknowledgement of Kaspersky\u2019s initial report on the family. The misspelling is intentional, in order to avoid the established microbiological notion, but also to have at least phonemic agreement.",

Security researchers subsequently linked these attacks to a broader, yearlong campaign that targeted not just Israelis but Palestinians as well \u2014 and as discovered later, even the U.S. and UK governments.\nhttps://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2013/08/operation-molerats-middle-east-cyber-attacks-using-poison-ivy.html\r\n**2013-06**: We observed several attacks in June and July 2013 against targets in the Middle East and the U.S. that dropped a PIVY payload that connected to command-and-control (CnC) infrastructure used by the Molerats attackers.\nhttps://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2013/08/operation-molerats-middle-east-cyber-attacks-using-poison-ivy.html\r\n**2014-04**: Between 29 April and 27 May, FireEye Labs identified several new Molerats attacks targeting at least one major U.S. financial institution and multiple, European government organizations.\nhttps://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2014/06/molerats-here-for-spring.html\r\n**2014 Summer**: Attacks against Israeli & Palestinian interests\nThe decoy documents and filenames used in the attacks suggest the intended targets include organizations with political interests or influence in Israel and Palestine.\nhttps://pwc.blogs.com/cyber_security_updates/2015/04/attacks-against-israeli-palestinian-interests.html\r\n**2014**: Operation \u201cMoonlight\u201d\nVectra Threat Labs researchers have uncovered the activities of a group of individuals currently engaged in targeted attacks against entities in the Middle East. We identified over 200 samples of malware generated by the group over the last two years. These attacks are themed around Middle Eastern political issues and the motivation appears to relate to espionage, as opposed to opportunistic or criminal intentions.\nhttps://blog.vectra.ai/blog/moonlight-middle-east-targeted-attacks\r\n**2015-05**: One interesting new fact about Gaza Cybergang activities is that they are actively sending malware files to IT (Information Technology) and IR (Incident Response) staff; this is also obvious from the file names they are sending to victims, which reflect the IT functions or IR tools used in cyberattack investigations.\nhttps://securelist.com/gaza-cybergang-wheres-your-ir-team/72283/\r\n**2015-09**: Operation \u201cDustySky\u201d\nThese attacks are targeted, but not spear-phished. I.e., malicious email messages are sent to selected targets rather than random mass distribution, but are not tailored specifically to each and every target. Dozens of targets may receive the exact same message. The email message and the lure document are written in Hebrew, Arabic or English \u2013depending on the target audience. Targeted sectors include governmental and diplomatic institutions, including embassies; companies from the aerospace and defense Industries; financial institutions; journalists; software developers. The attackers have been targeting software developers in general, using a fake website pretending to be a legitimate iOS management software, and linking to it in an online freelancing marketplace.\nhttps://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Operation%20DustySky_TLP_WHITE.pdf\r\n**2015-12**: Palo Alto Networks Traps Advanced Endpoint Protection recently prevented recent attacks that we believe are part of a campaign linked to DustySky.\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-downeks-and-quasar-rat-used-in-recent-targeted-attacks-against-governments/\r\n**2016-04**: Operation \u201cDustySky\u201d Part 2\nAttacks against all targets in the Middle East stopped at once, after we published our first report. However, the attacks against targets in the Middle East (except Israel) were renewed in less than 20 days. In the beginning of April 2016, we found evidence that the attacks against Israel have been renewed as well. Based on the type of targets, on Gaza being the source of the attacks, and on the type of information the attackers are after \u2013we estimate with medium-high certainty that the Hamas terrorist organization is behind these attacks.\nhttps://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Operation-DustySky2_-6.2016_TLP_White.pdf\nhttps://kc.mcafee.com/resources/sites/MCAFEE/content/live/PRODUCT_DOCUMENTATION/26000/PD26760/en_US/McAfee_Labs_Threat_Advisory_GazaCybergang.pdf\r\n**2016-11**: PwC analysts have been tracking the same malware campaign, which has seen a noticeable spike since at least April 2016. The attackers have targeted Arabic news websites, political figures and other targets that possess influence in the Palestinian territories and other neighbouring Arab countries.\nOur investigation began by  nalyzing around 20 executable files associated with the attacks. Several of these files opened decoy documents and audio files, which were exclusively in Arabic-language.\nhttps://pwc.blogs.com/cyber_security_updates/2016/11/molerats-theres-more-to-the-naked-eye.html\r\n**2017 Mid**: New targets, use of MS Access Macros and CVE 2017-0199, and possible mobile espionage\nOne of the interesting new facts, uncovered in mid-2017, is its discovery inside an oil and gas organization in the MENA region, infiltrating systems and pilfering data, apparently for more than a year.\nAnother interesting finding is the use of the recently discovered CVE 2017-0199 vulnerability, and Microsoft Access files into which the download scripts were embedded to reduce the likelihood of their detection. Traces of mobile malware that started to appear from late April 2017, are also being investigated.\nhttps://securelist.com/gaza-cybergang-updated-2017-activity/82765/\r\n**2017-09**: Operation \u201cTopHat\u201d\nIn recent months, Palo Alto Networks Unit 42 observed a wave of attacks leveraging popular third-party services Google+, Pastebin, and bit.ly.\nThe attacks we found within the TopHat campaign began in early September 2017. In a few instances, original filenames of the identified samples were written in Arabic.\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-the-tophat-campaign-attacks-within-the-middle-east-region-using-popular-third-party-services/\r\n**2019-01**: \u201cSpark\u201d Campaign\nThis campaign uses social engineering to infect victims, mainly from the Palestinian territories, with the Spark backdoor. This backdoor first emerged in January 2019 and has been continuously active since then. The campaign\u2019s lure content revolves around recent geopolitical events, espeically the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the assassination of Qasem Soleimani, and the ongoing conflict between Hamas and Fatah Palestinian movements.\nhttps://www.cybereason.com/blog/new-cyber-espionage-campaigns-targeting-palestinians-part-one\r\n**2019-02**: New Attack in the Middle East\nRecently, 360 Threat Intelligence Center captured a bait document designed specifically for Arabic users. It is an Office Word document with malicious macros embedded to drop and execute a backdoor packed by Enigma Virtual Box. The backdoor program has a built-in keyword list containing names of people or opera movies to communicate with C2, distributes control commands to further control the victim\u2019s computer device. After investigation, we suspect this attack is carried out by Molerats.\nhttps://ti.360.net/blog/articles/suspected-molerats-new-attack-in-the-middle-east-en/\r\n**2019-04**: Operation \u201cSneakyPastes\u201d\nThe campaign is multistage. It begins with phishing, using letters from one-time addresses and one-time domains. Sometimes the letters contain links to malware or infected attachments. If the victim executes the attached file (or follows the link), their device receives Stage One malware programmed to activate the infection chain.\nhttps://www.kaspersky.com/blog/gaza-cybergang/26363/\r\n**2019-10**: Between October 2019 through the beginning of December 2019, Unit 42 observed multiple instances of phishing attacks likely related to a threat group known as Molerats (AKA Gaza Hackers Team and Gaza Cybergang) targeting eight organizations in six different countries in the government, telecommunications, insurance and retail industries, of which the latter two were quite peculiar.\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/molerats-delivers-spark-backdoor/\r\n**2019-12**: \u201cPierogi\u201d Campaign\nThis campaign uses social engineering attacks to infect victims with a new, undocumented backdoor dubbed Pierogi. This backdoor first emerged in December 2019, and was discovered by Cybereason. In this campaign, the attackers use different TTPs and decoy documents reminiscent of previous campaigns by MoleRATs involving the Micropsia and Kaperagent malware.\nhttps://www.cybereason.com/blog/new-cyber-espionage-campaigns-targeting-palestinians-part-one\r\n**2020-03**: Molerats Delivers Spark Backdoor to Government and Telecommunications Organizations\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/molerats-delivers-spark-backdoor/\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/hackers-hide-malware-c2-communication-by-faking-news-site-traffic/\r\n**2020-10**: New Malware Arsenal Abuses Cloud Platforms in Middle East Espionage Campaign\nhttps://www.cybereason.com/hubfs/dam/collateral/reports/Molerats-in-the-Cloud-New-Malware-Arsenal-Abuses-Cloud-Platforms-in-Middle-East-Espionage-Campaign.pdf\nhttps://www.cybereason.com/blog/molerats-apt-new-malware-and-techniques-in-middle-east-espionage-campaign\r\n**2021 Early**: New TA402 Molerats Malware Targets Governments in the Middle East\nhttps://www.proofpoint.com/us/blog/threat-insight/new-ta402-molerats-malware-targets-governments-middle-east\r\n**2021-04**: Threat Group Uses Voice Changing Software in Espionage Attempt\nhttps://www.cadosecurity.com/post/threat-group-uses-voice-changing-software-in-espionage-attempt\r\n",

            "operations": "**2017-02**: The MuddyWater attacks are primarily against Middle Eastern nations. However, we have also observed attacks against surrounding nations and beyond, including targets in India and the USA.\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-muddying-the-water-targeted-attacks-in-the-middle-east/\r\n**2018-01**: Updated Tactics, Techniques and Procedures in Spear Phishing Campaign\nWe attribute this activity to TEMP.Zagros (reported by Palo Alto Networks and Trend Micro as MuddyWater), an Iran-nexus actor that has been active since at least May 2017. This actor has engaged in prolific spear phishing of government and defense entities in Central and Southwest Asia.\nhttps://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2018/03/iranian-threat-group-updates-ttps-in-spear-phishing-campaign.html\r\n**2018-03**: Campaign Possibly Connected to \u201cMuddyWater\u201d Surfaces in the Middle East and Central Asia\nWe discovered a new campaign targeting organizations in Turkey, Pakistan and Tajikistan that has some similarities with an earlier campaign named MuddyWater, which hit various industries in several countries, primarily in the Middle East and Central Asia.\nhttps://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/campaign-possibly-connected-muddywater-surfaces-middle-east-central-asia/\r\n**2018-05**: Another Potential MuddyWater Campaign uses Powershell-based PRB-Backdoor\nIn May 2018, we found a new sample (Detected as W2KM_DLOADR.UHAOEEN) that may be related to this campaign. Like the previous campaigns, these samples again involve a Microsoft Word document embedded with a malicious macro that is capable of executing PowerShell (PS) scripts leading to a backdoor payload. One notable difference in the analyzed samples is that they do not directly download the Visual Basic Script(VBS) and PowerShell component files, and instead encode all the scripts on the document itself. The scripts will then be decoded and dropped to execute the payload without needing to download the component files.\nhttps://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/another-potential-muddywater-campaign-uses-powershell-based-prb-backdoor/\r\n**2018-05**: We recently noticed a large amount of spear phishing documents that appear to be targeting government bodies, military entities, telcos and educational institutions in Jordan, Turkey, Azerbaijan and Pakistan, in addition to the continuous targeting of Iraq and Saudi Arabia, other victims were also detected in Mali, Austria, Russia, Iran and Bahrain.. These new documents have appeared throughout 2018 and escalated from May onwards. The attacks are still ongoing.\nhttps://securelist.com/muddywater/88059/\r\n**2018-09**: Group remains highly active with more than 130 victims in 30 organizations hit since September 2018.\nSeedworm\u2019s motivations are much like many cyber espionage groups that we observe\u2014they seek to acquire actionable information about the targeted organizations and individuals. They accomplish this with a preference for speed and agility over operational security, which ultimately led to our identification of their key operational infrastructure.\nhttps://www.symantec.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/seedworm-espionage-group\r\n**2018-11**: Operations in Lebanon and Oman\nMuddyWater has recently been targeting victims likely from Lebanon and Oman, while leveraging compromised domains, one of which is owned by an Israeli web developer. The investigation aimed to uncover additional details regarding the compromise vector. Further, we wished to determine the infection vector, which is currently unknown. With that in mind, past experience implies that this might be a two-stage spear-phishing campaign.\nhttps://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/MuddyWater-Operations-in-Lebanon-and-Oman.pdf\r\n**2019-04**: Targeting Kurdish Political Groups and Organizations in Turkey\nHowever, unlike the previous vector, we did not identify this time any compromised servers used to host the malware\u2019s code. Instead, the lure document already contains the malicious code. We also detected five additional files that operate in a similar file to the aforementioned document; but unlike that file, these do not have any content.\nhttps://www.clearskysec.com/muddywater-targets-kurdish-groups-turkish-orgs/\r\n**2019-04**: The Iranian APT, MuddyWater, has been active since at least 2017. Most recently though, a new campaign, targeting Belarus, Turkey and Ukraine, has emerged that caught the attention of Check Point researchers.\nhttps://research.checkpoint.com/the-muddy-waters-of-apt-attacks/\r\n**2019-04**: Operation \u201cBlackWater\u201d\nNewly associated samples from April 2019 indicate attackers have added three distinct steps to their operations, allowing them to bypass certain security controls and suggesting that MuddyWater\u2019s tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) have evolved to evade detection.\nhttps://blog.talosintelligence.com/2019/05/recent-muddywater-associated-blackwater.html\r\n**2019-06**: Clearsky has detected new and advanced attack vector used by MuddyWater to target governmental entities and the telecommunication sector. Notably, the TTP includes decoy documents exploiting CVE-2017-0199 as the first stage of the attack. This is followed by the second stage of the attack \u2013 communication with the hacked C2 servers and downloading a file infected with the macros.\nhttps://www.clearskysec.com/muddywater2/\r\n**2019-06**: We came across new campaignsthat seem to bear the markings of MuddyWater \u2013a threat actor group with a history of targeting organizations in Middle Eastern and Asian countries. The group used new tools and payloads in campaigns over the first half of 2019, pointing to the continued work the group has put in since our last report on MuddyWaterin November 2018.\nhttps://documents.trendmicro.com/assets/white_papers/wp_new_muddywater_findings_uncovered.pdf\r\n**2019-12**: Group continues to be highly active in 2020, while tentative links to recently discovered PowGoop tool suggest possible retooling.\nhttps://symantec-enterprise-blogs.security.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/seedworm-apt-iran-middle-east\r\n**2020-09**: Operation \u201cQuicksand\u201d\nDuring September 2020, weidentified a new campaign targeting many prominent Israeli organizations.\nhttps://www.clearskysec.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Operation-Quicksand.pdf\r\n**2020-10**: MSTIC has observed activity by the nation-state actor MERCURY using the CVE-2020-1472 exploit (ZeroLogon) in active campaigns over the last 2 weeks.\nhttps://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-says-iranian-hackers-are-exploiting-the-zerologon-vulnerability/\r\n**2020-12**: GitHub-hosted malware calculates Cobalt Strike payload from Imgur pic\nhttps://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/github-hosted-malware-calculates-cobalt-strike-payload-from-imgur-pic/\r\n**2021-02**: Probable Iranian Cyber Actors, Static Kitten, Conducting Cyberespionage Campaign Targeting UAE and Kuwait Government Agencies\nhttps://www.anomali.com/blog/probable-iranian-cyber-actors-static-kitten-conducting-cyberespionage-campaign-targeting-uae-and-kuwait-government-agencies\r\n**2021-02**: Operation \u201cEarth Vetala\u201d\nEarth Vetala used spearphishing emails with embedded links to a legitimate file-sharing service to distribute their malicious package.

Further analysis revealed a wider campaign with unique tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). This adversary targets non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in general, but uses Mongolian language decoys and themes, suggesting this actor has a specific focus on gathering intelligence on Mongolia. These campaigns involve the use of shared malware like Poison Ivy or PlugX.\n\nRecently, Falcon Intelligence observed new activity from Mustang Panda, using a unique infection chain to target likely Mongolia-based victims.

We also noted some of its noteworthy techniques, which include its capability to hide its malicious codes by decrypting and loading a backdoor \u201cexecutable file\u201d directly into memory, without the need to drop the actual \u201cexecutable file\u201d.\nRecently, we uncovered a RAT using the same technique. The new sample detected by Trend Micro as BKDR_RARSTONE.A is similar (but not) PlugX, as it directly loads a backdoor \u201cfile\u201d in memory without dropping any \u201cfile\u201d. However, as we proceeded with our analysis, we found that BKDR_RARSTONE has some tricks of its own.\nhttps://blog.trendmicro.com/trendlabs-security-intelligence/bkdr_rarstone-new-rat-to-watch-out-for/\r\n**2014-03**: Campaign in the wake of the MH370 tragedy\nBy March 11th, the Naikon group was actively hitting most of the nations involved in the search for MH370.

Additionally, some possible timestomping muddies the water between this operation possible originating in 2008-2009 or actually coming into full force in 2010-2013 (the latter dates being corroborated by VT firstseen submission times and second-stage drop timestamps). There\u2019s a level of variable developmental capability visible throughout the stages. Multiple components are abused commonly-available resources, while the orchestrator and two of the DLL drops actually display some developmental ingenuity (in the form of seemingly novel COM techniques). Far from the most advanced coding practices but definitely better than the sort of .NET garbage other \u2018Farsi-speaking\u2019 APTs have gotten away with in the past.\n\nSomehow, this operation found its way onto the NSA\u2019s radar pre-2013. As far as I can tell, it\u2019s eluded specific coverage from the security industry. A possible scenario to account for the disparate visibility between the NSA and Western researchers when it comes to this cluster of activity is that these samples were exclusively encountered on Iranian boxes overlapping with EQGRP implants. Submissions of Nazar subcomponents from Iran (as well as privately shared visibility into historical and ongoing victimology clustered entirely on Iranian machines) could support that theory. Perhaps this is an internal monitoring framework (a la Attor) but given the sparse availability of historical data, I wouldn\u2019t push that beyond a low-confidence assessment, at this time.",

These attacks have involved social engineering, spear-phishing attacks, exploitation of Microsoft Windows operating systems vulnerabilities, Microsoft Active Directory compromises, and the use of remote administration tools (RATs) in targeting and harvesting sensitive competitive proprietary operations and project-financing information with regard to oil and gas field bids and operations.\n\nAttackers using several locations in China have leveraged C&C servers on purchased hosted services in the United States and compromised servers in the Netherlands to wage attacks against global oil, gas, and petrochemical companies, as well as individuals and executives in Kazakhstan, Taiwan, Greece, and the United States to acquire proprietary and highly confidential information. The primary operational technique used by the attackers comprised a variety of hacker tools, including privately developed and customized RAT tools that provided complete remote administration capabilities to the attacker. RATs provide functions similar to Citrix or Microsoft Windows Terminal Services, allowing a remote individual to completely control the affected system. To deploy these tools, attackers first compromised perimeter security controls, through SQL-injection exploits of extranet web servers, as well as targeted spear-phishing attacks of mobile worker laptops, and compromising corporate VPN accounts to penetrate the targeted company\u2019s defensive architectures (DMZs and firewalls) and conduct reconnaissance of targeted companies\u2019 networked computers.\n\nNight Dragon may be related to {{APT 18, Dynamite Panda, Wekby}}.",

The threat group is notable because it employs Visual Basic Scripts (VBScripts) as a backdoor, a tactic we do not often observe. The group can maintain a low profile probably because the VBScripts are small and stealthy in their execution. The NINEBLOG malware is difficult to detect because the VBScripts are encoded and the actors employ SSL network communications. We have observed intermittent activity from this group since we first identified it in 2013, and we saw a spike in activity during mid-2015.\n\nWe assess that one of the probable targets of the group\u2019s 2015 campaign is a Southeast Asian government, based on the specificity of some of the decoy documents.\n\nIn addition to the anti-analysis techniques, the group has used SSL communications since we first identified this activity in 2013.

FireEye assesses that the group works on behalf of the Iranian government based on infrastructure details that contain references to Iran, use of Iranian infrastructure, and targeting that aligns with nation-state interests. This group was previously tracked under two distinct groups, APT 34 and OilRig, but was combined due to additional reporting giving higher confidence about the overlap of the activity.\n\nOilRig has 1 subgroup:\n1. {{Subgroup: Greenbug, Volatile Kitten}}\n\nOilRig seems to be closely related to {{APT 33, Elfin, Magnallium}} since at least 2017 and perhaps {{DNSpionage}}.",

The threat actors appear to be performing initial reconnaissance against would-be targets, and the attacks caught our attention since they were using unique scripts not commonly seen in crimeware campaigns.\nhttps://www.fireeye.com/blog/threat-research/2016/05/targeted_attacksaga.html\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/the-oilrig-campaign-attacks-on-saudi-arabian-organizations-deliver-helminth-backdoor/\r\n**2016-06**: We have identified two separate testing efforts carried out by the OilRig actors, one occurring in June and one in November of 2016. The sample set associated with each of these testing activities is rather small, but the changes made to each of the files give us a chance to understand what modifications the actor performs in an attempt to evade detection. This testing activity also suggests that the threat group responsible for the OilRig attack campaign have an organized, professional operations model that includes a testing component to the development of their tools.\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-oilrig-actors-provide-glimpse-development-testing-efforts/\r\n**2016-10**: In recent weeks we\u2019ve discovered that the group have been actively updating their Clayslide delivery documents, as well as the Helminth backdoor used against victims. Additionally, the scope of organizations targeted by this group has expanded to not only include organizations within Saudi Arabia, but also a company in Qatar and government organizations in Turkey, Israel and the United States.\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-oilrig-malware-campaign-updates-toolset-and-expands-targets/\r\n**2016-11**: Shamoon v2\nThe malware used in the recent attacks (W32.Disttrack.B) is largely unchanged from the variant used four years ago. In the 2012 attacks, infected computers had their master boot records wiped and replaced with an image of a burning US flag.

In these websites they hosted malware that was digitally signed with a valid, likely stolen code signing certificate.\nhttps://www.clearskysec.com/oilrig/\r\n**2017-06**: In July 2017, we observed the OilRig group using a tool they developed called ISMAgent in a new set of targeted attacks. The OilRig group developed ISMAgent as a variant of the ISMDoor Trojan. In August 2017, we found this threat group has developed yet another Trojan that they call \u2018Agent Injector\u2019 with the specific purpose of installing the ISMAgent backdoor. We are tracking this tool as ISMInjector.\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-oilrig-group-steps-attacks-new-delivery-documents-new-injector-trojan/\r\n**2017-07**: The web server logs on the system we examined that was compromised with the TwoFace shell gave us a glimpse into the commands the actor executed through their malware.

Just over a week later, on January 16, 2018, we observed an attack on a Middle Eastern financial institution. In both attacks, the OilRig group attempted to deliver a new Trojan that we are tracking as OopsIE.\nThe January 8 attack used a variant of the ThreeDollars delivery document, which we identified as part of the OilRig toolset based on attacks that occurred in August 2017.\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-oopsie-oilrig-uses-threedollars-deliver-new-trojan/\r\n**2018-01**: While investigating files uploaded to a TwoFace webshell, Unit 42 discovered actors installing an Internet Information Services (IIS) backdoor that we call RGDoor. Our data suggests that actors have deployed the RGDoor backdoor on webservers belonging to eight Middle Eastern government organizations, as well as one financial and one educational institution.\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-oilrig-uses-rgdoor-iis-backdoor-targets-middle-east/\r\n**2018-05**: Technology Service Provider and Government Agency\nBetween May and June 2018, Unit 42 observed multiple attacks by the OilRig group appearing to originate from a government agency in the Middle East. Based on previously observed tactics, it is highly likely the OilRig group leveraged credential harvesting and compromised accounts to use the government agency as a launching platform for their true attacks.\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-oilrig-targets-technology-service-provider-government-agency-quadagent/\r\n**2018-12**: Shamoon v3\nAfter a two-year absence, the destructive malware Shamoon (W32.Disttrack.B) re-emerged on December 10 in a new wave of attacks against targets in the Middle East.

Shamoon (W32.Disttrack) first made headlines in 2012 when it was used in attacks against energy companies in Saudi Arabia. It recently resurfaced in November 2016 (W32.Disttrack.B), again attacking targets in Saudi Arabia. While these attacks were covered extensively in the media, how the attackers stole these credentials and introduced W32.Disttrack on targeted organizations\u2019 networks remains a mystery.\n\nCould Greenbug be responsible for getting Shamoon those stolen credentials?\n\nAlthough there is no definitive link between Greenbug and Shamoon, the group compromised at least one administrator computer within a Shamoon-targeted organization\u2019s network prior to W32.Disttrack.B being deployed on November 17, 2016.",

The threat actor encrypted the company's entire corporate network and demanded a $50,000 ransom. It is common knowledge that Russian hackers have an unspoken rule about not working within Russia and post-Soviet countries. Yet OldGremlin, made up of Russian speakers, is actively attacking Russian companies: banks, industrial enterprises, medical organizations, software developers\u2026 According to Group-IB expert estimations, since the spring OldGremlin has conducted at least seven phishing campaigns. The hackers have impersonated the self-regulatory organization Mikrofinansirovaniye i Razvitiye (SRO MiR); a Russian metallurgical holding company; the Belarusian plant Minsk Tractor Works; a dental clinic; and the media holding company RBC.",

According to big data correlation analysis, OnionDog's first activity can be traced back to October, 2013 and in the following two years it was only active between late July and early September. The self-set life cycle of a Trojan attack is 15 days on average and is distinctly organizational and objective-oriented.\n\nOnionDog malware is transmitted by taking advantage of the vulnerability of the popular office software Hangul in Korean-language countries, and it attacked network-isolated targets through a USB Worm. In addition, OnionDog also used darkweb ('Onion City') communications tools, with which it can visit the domain without the Onion browser, making its real identity hidden in the completely anonymous Tor network.",

Researchers also found a broad campaign that uses the modular ModPOS malware to steal payment card data from retailers in the US.\n\nHowever, from what we have seen, it is not only retailers in the US that are at risk of breaches. Our researchers recently found an early version of a potentially powerful, adaptable, and invisible botnet that seeks out PoS systems within networks. It has already extended its reach to small and medium sized business networks all over the world, including a healthcare organization in the US. We are calling this operation Black Atlas, in reference to BlackPOS, the malware primarily used in this operation.\n\nOperation Black Atlas has been around since September 2015, just in time to plant its seeds before the holiday season. Its targets include businesses in the healthcare, retail, and more industries which rely on card payment systems.",

These have been highly active in the Middle East region and unveiled ongoing targeted attacks in multiple regions. The attackers try to lure targets through spear phishing emails that include compressed executables. The malware collects all data such as passwords, keystrokes and screenshots, then sends it to the attackers.\n\nWe found that the group behind this campaign targeted mainly industrial, engineering and manufacturing organizations in more than 30 countries. In total, over 130 organizations have been identified as victims of this campaign. Using the Kaspersky Security Network (KSN) and artifacts from malware files and attack sites, we were able to trace the attacks back to March 2015. Noteworthy is that since the beginning of their activities, the attackers\u2019 motivations are apparently financial, whether through the victims\u2019 banking accounts or through selling their intellectual property to interested parties, most infiltrated victim organizations are considered SMBs (Small to Medium size businesses, 30-300 employees), the utilization of commercial off-the-shelf malware makes the attribution of the attacks more difficult.",

The infection was reported to have been conducted via \u201cspear phishing\u201d emails sent to people in the upper tiers of management.\n\nInitially, we had no information or visibility into this case. However, after some time Norwegian CERT (NorCERT) shared some data from the event, which included md5 hashes of malicious files and information about which Command and Control servers were used.\n\nHowever, the data we were given acted as a starting point for more data mining, and within a short period of time it became obvious that we were seeing a previously unknown and very extensive infrastructure for targeted attacks. This paper is the result of the ensuing investigation.\n\nThe samples we have uncovered seem to have been created from approximately September 2010 until the present day. It appears 2012 was a very active year for this group, which saw escalation not only in numbers of created malware files but also in targets. There is no sign that the attacks will slow down in 2013, as we see new attacks continuously.\n\nIn a great number of isolated cases and contexts, the word \u201cAppin\u201d shows up and there seems to be some connection with the Indian security company called Appin Security Group.",

A hired actor is consistent with our findings on the Command and Control servers related to this campaign, which included web-based control panels for multiple RATs, suggesting that several campaigns were being run at once. A hired actor may also explain the generic and uninspired nature of the phishing, which often took the form of an email purporting to contain an invoice or a legal document with an attachment containing a blurry image. An investigation by the Swiss federal police of some of the emails linked to Operation Manul concludes that they were sent from IP addresses in India, which also suggests a link to Appin.",

The campaign started in 2017, with the attackers doing just enough to achieve their goals. They most likely have access to additional tools when needed and appear to have access to an elaborate database of contacts in sensitive organizations and personnel worldwide, especially of vulnerable and non-trained staff. The victim systems range from personal desktop or laptop systems to large servers with domain controller roles or similar. The nature of the targeted ministries varied, including those responsible for telecommunications, health, energy, justice, finance and so on.\n\nOperation Parliament appears to be another symptom of escalating tensions in the Middle East region. The attackers have taken great care to stay under the radar, imitating another attack group in the region. They have been particularly careful to verify victim devices before proceeding with the infection, safeguarding their command and control servers. The targeting seems to have slowed down since the beginning of 2018, probably winding down when the desired data or access was obtained. The targeting of specific victims is unlike previously seen behavior in regional campaigns by Gaza Cybergang or Desert Falcons and points to an elaborate information-gathering exercise that was carried out before the attacks (physical and/or digital).\n\nWith deception and false flags increasingly being employed by threat actors, attribution is a hard and complicated task that requires solid evidence, especially in complex regions such as the Middle East.\n\nAn overlap has been found between Operation Parliament and {{Molerats, Extreme Jackal, Gaza Cybergang}}.",

They also configured the update server to only deliver malicious files if the client is located in the range of IP addresses of their target organizations.\n\n9002 RAT also installed additional malicious tools: an exploit tool for Internet Information Services (IIS) 6 WebDav (exploiting CVE-2017-7269) and an SQL database password dumper.

McAfee has detected the malware variants and other relevant indicators for years with Generic Downloader.x and Generic BackDoor.t heuristic signatures (those who have had prior experience with this specific adversary may recognize it by the use of encrypted HTML comments in web pages that serve as a command channel to the infected machine).\n\nMcAfee has gained access to one specific Command & Control server used by the intruders. We have collected logs that reveal the full extent of the victim population since mid-2006 when the log collection began. Note that the actual intrusion activity may have begun well before that time but that is the earliest evidence we have for the start of the compromises. The compromises themselves were standard procedure for these types of targeted intrusions: a spear-phishing email containing an exploit is sent to an individual with the right level of access at the company, and the exploit when opened on an unpatched system will trigger a download of the implant malware. That malware will execute and initiate a backdoor communication channel to the Command & Control web server and interpret the instructions encoded in the hidden comments embedded in the webpage code. This will be quickly followed by live intruders jumping on to the infected machine and proceeding to quickly escalate privileges and move laterally within the organization to establish new persistent footholds via additional compromised machines running implant malware, as well as targeting for quick exfiltration the key data they came for.",

These attacks are still ongoing at the time of writing and are focused on both government institutions and private companies. For the latter, the most targeted sectors are energy and metallurgical. The attackers rely on the use of remote access trojans, most likely to spy on their victims. They have a large network infrastructure for command and control: ESET observed at least 24 different IP addresses in use in the second half of 2020. These are probably compromised devices that act as proxies for their C&C servers. This, combined with the use of dynamic DNS services, means that their infrastructure never stays still.

Based on the detection timestamps of that toolset, we assess that the attacker had a foothold in the network from as early as 2018;\n\u2022 A couple of other tools that have significant code overlaps with Moriya were found as well. These contain a user mode version of the malware and another driver-based utility used to defeat AV software.",

Kaspersky spyware sensors caught the signal of an attack from the device of one of the victims; and a hash of the APK involved (Android application) was tagged in our sample feed for inspection. Once we looked into the file, we quickly found out that the inner-workings of the APK included a malicious payload, embedded in the original code of the application. This was an original spyware program, designed to exfiltrate almost all accessible information.\n\nDuring the course of our research, we noticed that we were not the only ones to have found the operation. Researchers from Bitdefender also released an analysis of one of the samples in a blogpost. Although something had already been published, we decided to do something different with the data we acquired. The following month, we released a private report on our Threat Intelligence Portal to alert our clients about this newly discovered operation and began writing YARA rules in order to catch more samples.

Known victims include healthcare providers, pharmaceuticals, IT solution providers for healthcare and equipment manufacturers that serve the healthcare industry, likely for the purpose of corporate espionage.\n\nBased on the list of known victims, Orangeworm does not select its targets randomly or conduct opportunistic hacking. Rather, the group appears to choose its targets carefully and deliberately, conducting a good amount of planning before launching an attack.\n\nAccording to Symantec telemetry, almost 40 percent of Orangeworm\u2019s confirmed victim organizations operate within the healthcare industry. The Kwampirs malware was found on machines which had software installed for the use and control of high-tech imaging devices such as X-Ray and MRI machines. Additionally, Orangeworm was observed to have an interest in machines used to assist patients in completing consent forms for required procedures. The exact motives of the group are unclear.",

The nature and geographic spread of the targets seems to point to a sponsor, or sponsors, with regional, political interests. The attackers, whom we have named Packrat, have shown a keen and systematic interest in the political opposition and the independent press in so-called ALBA countries (Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas), and their recently allied regimes. These countries are linked by a trade agreement as well as a cooperation on a range of non-financial matters.\n\nAfter observing a wave of attacks in Ecuador in 2015, we linked these attacks to a campaign active in Argentina in 2014. The targeting in Argentina was discovered when the attackers attempted to compromise the devices of Alberto Nisman and Jorge Lanata. Building on what we had learned about these two campaigns, we then traced the group\u2019s activities back as far as 2008.\n\nThis report brings together many of the pieces of this campaign, from malware and phishing, to command and control infrastructure spread across Latin America. It also highlights fake online organizations that Packrat has created in Venezuela and Ecuador. Who is responsible? We assess several scenarios, and consider the most likely to be that Packrat is sponsored by a state actor or actors, given their apparent lack of concern about discovery, their targets, and their persistence. However, we do not conclusively attribute Packrat to a particular sponsor.",

Additionally, we have identified, with medium probability, a connection between this campaign and the {{APT 33, Elfin, Magnallium}} and {{Chafer, APT 39}} groups.The campaign was first revealed by Dragos, named \u201cParisite\u201dand attributed to APT33; we call the comprehensive campaign revealed in this report \u201cFox Kitten\u201d.\n\nThe initial breach of the targeted organizations was performed, in most cases, by exploiting 1-day vulnerabilities in different VPN services such as: Pulse Secure VPN, Fortinet VPN, and Global Protect by Palo Alto Networks. Upon gaining foothold at the target, the attackers tried to maintain the access to the networks by opening a variety of communication tools, including opening RDP links over SSH tunneling, in order to camouflage and encrypt the communication with the targets. At the final stage, after successfully infiltrating the organization, the attackers have performed a routine process of identification, examination, and filtering of sensitive, valuable information from every targeted organization.The valuable information was sent back to the attackers for reconnaissance, espionage, or further infection of connected networks.",

            "description": "(Cylance) Snorre Fagerland of Blue Coat Systems first coined the term PassCV in a blog post. His post provides a good introduction to the group and covers some of the older infrastructure, stolen code-signing certificate reuse, and other connections associated with the PassCV malware. There are several clues alluding to the possibility that multiple groups may be utilizing the same stolen signing certificates, but at this time SPEAR believes the current attacks are more likely being perpetrated by a single group employing multiple publicly available Remote Administration Tools (RATs).\n\nThe PassCV group has been operating with continued success and has already started to expand their malware repertoire into different off-the-shelf RATs and custom code. SPEAR identified eighteen previously undisclosed stolen Authenticode certificates. These certificates were originally issued to companies and individuals scattered across China, Taiwan, Korea, Europe, the United States and Russia.\n\nThe PassCV group typically utilized publicly available RATs in addition to some custom code, which ultimately provided backdoor functionality to affected systems via phony resumes and curriculum vitae (CVs). PassCV continues to maintain a heavy reliance on obfuscated and signed versions of older RATs like ZxShell and Ghost RAT, which have remained a favorite of the wider Chinese criminal community since their initial public release.",

There are indications of activity as early as 2014, but Cymmetria has not observed any such activity first hand.\n\nPatchwork targets were chosen worldwide with a focus on personnel working on military and political assignments, and specifically those working on issues relating to Southeast Asia and the South China Sea. Many of the targets were governments and government-related organizations.\n\nThe code used by this threat actor is copy-pasted from various online forums, in a way that reminds us of a patchwork quilt \u2013hence the name we\u2019ve given the operation.\n\nIn active victim systems, Patchwork immediately searches for and uploads documents to their C&C, and only if the target is deemed valuable enough, proceeds to install a more advanced second stage malware.\n\nThis group seems to be associated with {{Confucius}}.",

This change in tactics makes Pinchy Spider and its affiliates the latest eCrime adversaries to join the growing trend of targeted, low-volume/high-return ransomware deployments known as \u201cbig game hunting.\u201d\n\nPinchy Spider is the criminal group behind the development of the ransomware most commonly known as GandCrab, which has been active since January 2018. Pinchy Spider sells access to use GandCrab ransomware under a partnership program with a limited number of accounts. The program is operated with a 60-40 split in profits (60 percent to the customer), as is common among eCrime actors, but Pinchy Spider is also willing to negotiate up to a 70-30 split for \u201csophisticated\u201d customers.\n\nGandCrab and Sodinokibi have been observed to be distributed by DanaBot (operated by {{Scully Spider, TA547}}) and Taurus Loader (operated by {{Venom Spider, Golden Chickens}}).",

They have targeted private companies in several sectors, such as defense and telecommunications, but also at least one government.\n\nWe have been able to track down this group of attackers and can provide detailed information about them. We were able to collect and reveal their \u201cmalware arsenal\u201d. We also analyzed their technical organization.\n\nOur investigations indicate that Pitty Tiger has not used any 0day vulnerability so far, rather they prefer using custom malware, developed for the group\u2019s exclusive usage. Our discoveries indicate that Pitty Tiger is a group of attackers with the ability to stay under the radar, yet still not as mature as other groups of attackers we monitor.\n\nPitty Tiger is probably not a state-sponsored group of attackers. They lack the experience and financial support that one would expect from state-sponsored attackers. We suppose this group is opportunistic and sells its services to probable competitors of their targets in the private sector.\n\nWe have been able to leverage several attackers profiles, showing that the Pitty Tiger group is fairly small compared to other APT groups, which is probably why we saw them work on a very limited amount of targets.\n\nThere is some overlap with {{APT 5, Keyhole Panda}}.",

We say group or groups as our current visibility doesn\u2019t allow us to determine with high confidence if this is the work of one group, or more than one group which uses the same tools and has the same tasking.

Like many such groups, Platinum seeks to steal sensitive intellectual property related to government interests, but its range of preferred targets is consistently limited to specific governmental organizations, defense institutes, intelligence agencies, diplomatic institutions, and telecommunication providers in South and Southeast Asia. The group\u2019s persistent use of spear-phishing tactics (phishing attempts aimed at specific individuals) and access to previously undiscovered zero-day exploits have made it a highly resilient threat.",

The links led to code designed to exploit web browser vulnerabilities to install spyware on iOS and Android devices, and in some cases to OAuth phishing pages. This campaign was carried out by what appears to be a single operator that we call POISON CARP.\n\u2022 We observed POISON CARP employing a total of eight Android browser exploits and one Android spyware kit, as well as one iOS exploit chain and iOS spyware. None of the exploits that we observed were zero days. POISON CARP overlaps with two recently reported campaigns against the Uyghur community. The iOS exploit and spyware we observed was used in watering hole attacks reported by Google Project Zero, and a website used to serve exploits by POISON CARP was also observed in a campaign called \u201cEvil Eye\u201d reported by Volexity. The Android malware used in the campaign is a fully featured spyware kit that has not been previously documented.\n\u2022 POISON CARP appears to have used Android browser exploits from a variety of sources. In one case, POISON CARP used a working exploit publicly released by Exodus Intelligence for a Google Chrome bug that was fixed in source, but whose patch had not yet been distributed to Chrome users. In other cases, POISON CARP used lightly modified versions of Chrome exploit code published on the personal GitHub pages of a member of Qihoo 360\u2019s Vulcan Team, a member of Tencent\u2019s Xuanwu Lab, and by a Google Project Zero member on the Chrome Bug Tracker.\n\u2022 This campaign is the first documented case of one-click mobile exploits used to target Tibetan groups, and reflects an escalation in the sophistication of digital espionage threats targeting the community.",

This signals just how long ago the Poseidon threat actor was already working on its offensive framework.\n\nThe Poseidon Group is a long-running team operating on all domains: land, air, and sea. They are dedicated to running targeted attacks campaigns to aggressively collect information from company networks through the use of spear-phishing packaged with embedded, executable elements inside office documents and extensive lateral movement tools. The information exfiltrated is then leveraged by a company front to blackmail victim companies into contracting the Poseidon Group as a security firm. Even when contracted, the Poseidon Group may continue its infection or initiate another infection at a later time, persisting on the network to continue data collection beyond its contractual obligation. The Poseidon Group has been active, using custom code and evolving their toolkit since at least 2005. Their tools are consistently designed to function on English and Portuguese systems spanning the gamut of Windows OS, and their exfiltration methods include the use of hijacked satellite connections. Poseidon continues to be active at this time.",

LPE allows an executable or process to escalate privileges. In that specific case, it allows an executable launched by a restricted user to gain administrative rights.\n\nThe tweet linked to a GitHub repository that contains Proof-of-Concept code for the exploit. Not only was a compiled version released \u2013 the source code was also. Consequently, anyone can modify and recompile the exploit, in order to \u201cimprove it\u201d, evade detection, or even incorporate it into their code.\n\nAs one could have predicted, it took only two days before we first identified the use of this exploit in a malicious campaign from a group we have dubbed PowerPool. This group has a small number of victims and according to both our telemetry and uploads to VirusTotal (we only considered manual uploads from the web interface), the targeted countries include Chile, Germany, India, the Philippines, Poland, Russia, the United Kingdom, the United States and Ukraine.",

While some individual sightings of this attack were previously reported by other researchers and journalists, our investigation allowed us to connect the different campaigns and attribute them to the same attackers.\n\nAmong the different attack vectors we found were:\n\u2022 Four variants of Windows infostealers intended to steal the victim\u2019s personal documents as well as access to their Telegram Desktop and KeePass account information\n\u2022 Android backdoor that extracts two-factor authentication codes from SMS messages, records the phone\u2019s voice surroundings and more\n\u2022 Telegram phishing pages, distributed using fake Telegram service accounts\n\nThe above tools and methods appear to be mainly used against Iranian minorities, anti-regime organizations and resistance movements such as:\n\u2022 Association of Families of Camp Ashraf and Liberty Residents (AFALR)\n\u2022 Azerbaijan National Resistance Organization\n\u2022 Balochistan people",

Based on the evidence, these attacks appear to be conducted by the same set of attackers using previously unknown malware families. In addition, these attacks appear to be highly targeted in their distribution of the malware used, as well as the targets chosen. Based on these factors, Unit 42 believes the attackers behind these attacks are conducting their campaigns for espionage purposes.\n\nWe believe this group is previously unidentified and therefore have we have dubbed it \u201cRancor\u201d. The Rancor group\u2019s attacks use two primary malware families which we describe in depth later in this blog and are naming DDKONG and PLAINTEE. DDKONG is used throughout the campaign and PLAINTEE appears to be new addition to these attackers\u2019 toolkit.\n\nKaspersky found connections between this group and {{DragonOK}}.",

The campaigns targeted industrial companies in Europe, the Middle East, and the Republic of Korea. This leads us to believe that they are all the work of the same actors\u2014a group we\u2019ve dubbed RATicate.\n\nA new campaign we believe connected to the same actors leverages concern about the global COVID-19 pandemic to convince victims to open the payloads. This is a shift in tactics, but we suspect that this group constantly changes the way they deploy malware\u2014and that the group has conducted campaigns prior to this past November.",

The campaigns, which we are collectively naming RedAlpha, combine light reconnaissance, selective targeting, and diverse malicious tooling. We discovered this activity as the result of pivoting off of a new malware sample observed targeting the Tibetan community based in India.\n\nInsikt Group\u2019s analysis of infrastructure overlap among the new campaigns reveals wider targeting of the Chinese \u201cFive Poisons,\u201d in addition to South and Southeast Asian governments. Based on the campaign\u2019s targeting of \u201cFive Poisons\u201d-related organizations, overlapping infrastructure, and links to malware used by other Chinese APTs uncovered during our research, we assess with medium confidence that the RedAlpha campaigns were conducted by a Chinese APT.\n\nInfrastructure overlaps have been found with {{APT 17, Deputy Dog, Elderwood, Sneaky Panda}}, {{Icefog, Dagger Panda}} and {{NetTraveler, APT 21, Hammer Panda}}.",

            "description": "(Recorded Future) From early May 2020, The Vatican and the Catholic Diocese of Hong Kong were among several Catholic Church-related organizations that were targeted by RedDelta, a Chinese-state sponsored threat activity group tracked by Insikt Group. This series of suspected network intrusions also targeted the Hong Kong Study Mission to China and the Pontifical Institute for Foreign Missions (PIME), Italy. These organizations have not been publicly reported as targets of Chinese threat activity groups prior to this campaign.\n\nThese network intrusions occured ahead of the anticipated September 2020 renewal of the landmark 2018 China-Vatican provisional agreement, a deal which reportedly resulted in the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) gaining more control and oversight over the country\u2019s historically persecuted \u201cunderground\u201d Catholic community. In addition to the Holy See itself, another likely target of the campaign includes the current head of the Hong Kong Study Mission to China, whose predecessor was considered to have played a vital role in the 2018 agreement.\n\nThe suspected intrusion into the Vatican would offer RedDelta insight into the negotiating position of the Holy See ahead of the deal\u2019s September 2020 renewal. The targeting of the Hong Kong Study Mission and its Catholic Diocese could also provide a valuable intelligence source for both monitoring the diocese\u2019s relations with the Vatican and its position on Hong Kong\u2019s pro-democracy movement amidst widespread protests and the recent sweeping Hong Kong national security law.\n\nWhile there is considerable overlap between the observed TTPs of RedDelta and the threat activity group publicly referred to as {{Mustang Panda, Bronze President}} (also known as BRONZE PRESIDENT and HoneyMyte), there are a few notable distinctions which lead us to designate this activity as RedDelta:\n\u2022 The version of PlugX used by RedDelta in this campaign uses a different C2 traffic encryption method and has a different configuration encryption mechanism than traditional PlugX.\n\u2022 The malware infection chain employed in this campaign has not been publicly reported as used by Mustang Panda.\n\nIn addition to the targeting of entities related to the Catholic Church, Insikt Group also identified RedDelta targeting law enforcement and government entities in India and a government organization in Indonesia.",

From mid-2020 onwards, Recorded Future\u2019s midpoint collection revealed a steep rise in the use of infrastructure tracked as AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE, which encompasses ShadowPad command and control (C2) servers, to target a large swathe of India\u2019s power sector. 10 distinct Indian power sector organizations, including 4 of the 5 Regional Load Despatch Centres (RLDC) responsible for operation of the power grid through balancing electricity supply and demand, have been identified as targets in a concerted campaign against India\u2019s critical infrastructure. Other targets identified included 2 Indian seaports.\n\nUsing a combination of proactive adversary infrastructure detections, domain analysis, and Recorded Future Network Traffic Analysis, we have determined that a subset of these AXIOMATICASYMPTOTE servers share some common infrastructure tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) with several previously reported Chinese state-sponsored groups, including {{APT 41}} and {{Tonto Team, HartBeat, Karma Panda}}.\n\nDespite some overlaps with previous groups, Insikt Group does not currently believe there is enough evidence to firmly attribute the activity in this particular campaign to an existing public group and therefore continue to track it as a closely related but distinct activity group, RedEcho.",

One such popular product in the underground economy is ransomware. In ransomware attacks, data from infected systems is held hostage (encrypted) until a fee is paid to the criminals. This modus operandi disrupts legitimate businesses, which may become unavailable until the data is restored. A recent blackmailing strategy adopted by criminals is to leak data online from the infected systems if the ransom is not paid. Besides reputational damage, data leakage might produce further economical losses due to fines imposed by data protection laws. Thus, research on prevention and recovery measures to mitigate the impact of such attacks is needed to adapt existing countermeasures to new strains.",

Attackers usually perform one of two things, Newsbeef has been performing the first of the two:\n\n- inject a src or iframe link into web pages or css sheets\n- inject the content of an entire BeEF web page into one of the internally linked javascript helpers\n\nThe injected link will redirect visitors\u2019 browsers to a BeEF server. Usually, the attackers deliver some of the tracking and system/browser identification and evercookie capabilities. Sometimes, it appears that they deliver the metasploit integration to exploit and deliver backdoors (we haven\u2019t identified that exploitation activity in our ksn data related to this group just yet). Sometimes, it is used to pop up spoofed login input fields to steal social networking site credentials. We also haven\u2019t detected that in ksn, but some partners have privately reported it about various incidents. But we have identified that attackers will redirect specific targets to laced Adobe Flash and other installers from websites that they operate.\n\nSo, the watering hole activity isn\u2019t always and usually isn\u2019t delivering backdoors. Most of the time, the watering hole injections are used to identify and track visitors or steal their browser history. Then, they deliver the backdoors to the right targets.\n\nThere is some infrastructure overlap with {{Magic Hound, APT 35, Cobalt Gypsy, Charming Kitten}} and {{ITG18}}.",

Once they have this access, a lot of the work is done manually, slowly getting to understand the network layout and deploying custom tools the criminals can use to steal funds from these entities. Some of the groups that best exemplify these trends are {{Buhtrap, Ratopak Spider}}, {{Cobalt Group}} and {{Corkow, Metel}}.\n\nThe group discussed in this white paper is part of this new trend. We call this new group RTM; it uses custom malware, written in Delphi, that we cover in detail in later sections. The first trace of this tool in our telemetry data dates back to late 2015. The group also makes use of several different modules that they deploy where appropriate to their targets. They are interested in users of remote banking systems (RBS), mainly in Russia and neighboring countries.\n\nThat this group is mostly targeting businesses is apparent from the processes they are looking for on a compromised system. They look for software that is usually only installed on accountants\u2019 computers, such as remote banking software or tools to help with accounts pay.",

Because \u201cnoisier\u201d campaigns are becoming increasingly well-known within the security community, new and smaller campaigns are beginning to emerge.\n\nThis research paper documents the operations of a campaign we refer to as \u201cSafe,\u201d based on the names of the malicious files used. It is an emerging and active targeted threat.\n\nWhile we have yet to determine the campaign\u2019s total number of victims, it appears that nearly 12,000 unique IP addresses spread over more than 100 countries were connected to two sets of command-and-control (C&C) infrastructures related to Safe. We also discovered that the average number of actual victims remained at 71 per day, with few if any changes from day to day. This indicates that the actual number of victims is far less than the number of unique IP addresses. Due to large concentrations of IP addresses within specific network blocks, it is likely that the number of victims is even smaller and that they have dynamically assigned IP addresses, which have been compromised for some time now.",

Beginning in 2009, we\u2019ve observed this actor conduct more than 40 unique campaigns that we\u2019ve identified in the malware configurations\u2019 campaign codes. These codes are often leveraged in the malware used by coordinated targeted attackers to differentiate victims that were successfully compromised from different target sets.\n\nThe implant delivered by Samurai Panda uses a typical installation process whereby they:\n1. Leverage a spear-phish with an exploit to get control of the execution flow of the targeted application. This file \u201cdrops\u201d an XOR-encoded payload that unpacks itself and a configuration file.\n2. Next, the implant, which can perform in several different modes, typically will install itself as a service and then begin beaconing out to an adversary-controlled host.\n3. If that command-and-control host is online, the malicious service will download and instantiate a backdoor that provides remote access to the attacker, who will see the infected host\u2019s identification information as well as the campaign code.",

This group has not been directly linked to a government source, but the group\u2019s motivations appear to overlap with those of the Chinese government. While there is some overlap between IP addresses used by Scarlet Mimic and {{Putter Panda, APT 2}}, it has not been concluded that the groups are the same.\n\n(Palo Alto) The attacks began over four years ago and their targeting pattern suggests that this adversary\u2019s primary mission is to gather information about minority rights activists. We do not have evidence directly linking these attacks to a government source, but the information derived from these activities supports an assessment that a group or groups with motivations similar to the stated position of the Chinese government in relation to these targets is involved.\n\nThe attacks we attribute to Scarlet Mimic have primarily targeted Uyghur and Tibetan activists as well as those who are interested in their causes. Both the Tibetan community and the Uyghurs, a Turkic Muslim minority residing primarily in northwest China, have been targets of multiple sophisticated attacks in the past decade. Both also have history of strained relationships with the government of the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), though we do not have evidence that links Scarlet Mimic attacks to the PRC.\n\nScarlet Mimic attacks have also been identified against government organizations in Russia and India, who are responsible for tracking activist and terrorist activities. While we do not know the precise target of each of the Scarlet Mimic attacks, many of them align to the patterns described above.",

The ongoing operation likely began as early as January 2017 and has continued through the first quarter of 2019. Our investigation revealed that at least 40 different organizations across 13 different countries were compromised during this campaign. We assess with high confidence that this activity is being carried out by an advanced, state-sponsored actor that seeks to obtain persistent access to sensitive networks and systems.\n\nThe actors behind this campaign have focused on using DNS hijacking as a mechanism for achieving their ultimate objectives. DNS hijacking occurs when the actor can illicitly modify DNS name records to point users to actor-controlled servers. The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) issued an alert about this activity on Jan. 24 2019, warning that an attacker could redirect user traffic and obtain valid encryption certificates for an organization\u2019s domain names.",

Mabna Institute earned the moniker 'Silent Librarian' due to its focused efforts to compromise university students and faculty by impersonating university library resources using domain shadowing to harvest credentials.\n\nHowever, while RiskIQ's findings are consistent with TTPs in use by Silent Librarian, they alone are not sufficient to attribute the threat activity we've detected against these 20 universities directly to Mabna Institute.

The report also contains an analysis of data which were stolen from politically sensitive targets and recovered during the course of the investigation. These include documents from the Offices of the Dalai Lama and agencies of the Indian national security establishment. Data containing sensitive information on citizens of numerous third-party countries, as well as personal, financial, and business information, were also exfiltrated and recovered during the course of the investigation. The report analyzes the malware ecosystem employed by the Shadows\u2019 attackers, which leveraged multiple redundant cloud computing systems, social networking platforms, and free web hosting services in order to maintain persistent control while operating core servers located in the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC). Although the identity and motivation of the attackers remain unknown, the report is able to determine the location (Chengdu, PRC) as well as some of the associations of the attackers through circumstantial evidence. The investigation is the product of an eight month, collaborative activity between the Information Warfare Monitor (Citizen Lab and SecDev) and the Shadowserver Foundation. The investigation employed a fusion methodology, combining technical interrogation techniques, data analysis, and field research, to track and uncover the Shadow cyber espionage network.\n\nAlso see {{GhostNet, Snooping Dragon}}.",

Related activities date back to more than a decade ago, with similar code maintaining compilation timestamps from 2004. Since then, ShaggyPanther activity has been detected in several more locations: most recently in Indonesia in July, and \u2013 somewhat surprisingly \u2013 in Syria in March. The newer 2018 and 2019 backdoor code maintains a new layer of obfuscation and no longer maintains clear-text C2 strings. Since our original release, we have identified an initial server-side infection vector from this actor, using SinoChopper/ChinaChopper, a commonly used web shell shared by multiple Chinese-speaking actors. SinoChopper not only performs host identification and backdoor delivery but also email archive theft and additional activity. Although not all incidents can be traced back to server-side exploitation, we did detect a couple of cases and obtained information about their staged install process. In 2019, we observed ShaggyPanther targeting Windows servers.",

The tools, modus operandi, and infrastructure used in the campaign present two possibilities: either the Chinese cyber-espionage unit {{Comment Crew, APT 1}} is perpetrating this activity, or another group is using the same tactics and tools as the legacy APT1.\n\nThe Siesta campaign reinforces the fact that analysts and network defenders should remain on the lookout for known, public indicators and for shared attributes that allow security experts to detect multiple actors with one signature.",

Group-IB security analysts\u2019 hypothesis is that at least one of the gang members appears to be a former or current employee of a cyber security company. The confirmed damage from Silence activity is estimated at 800 000 USD.\n\nSilence is a group of Russian-speaking hackers, based on their commands language, the location of infrastructure they used, and the geography of their targets (Russia, Ukraine, Belarus, Azerbaijan, Poland, and Kazakhstan). Although phishing emails were also sent to bank employees in Central and Western Europe, Africa, and Asia). Furthermore, Silence used Russian words typed on an English keyboard layout for the commands of the employed backdoor.

While referencing a real report published by HRW, the links provided for the Director\u2019s biography and article directed the recipient to malware hosted elsewhere. These spear-phishing attempts represent an evolution of Iranian actors based on their social engineering tactics and narrow targeting. Although the messages still had minor grammatical and stylistic errors that would be obvious to a native speaker, the actors demonstrated stronger English\u00adlanguage proficiency than past intrusion sets and a deeper investment in background research prior to the attempt. The actors appropriated a real identity that would be expected to professionally interact with the subject, then offered validation through links to their biography and social media, the former of which itself was malware as well. The bait documents contained a real article relevant to their interests and topic referenced, and the message attempted to address to how it aligned with their professional research or field of employment. The referenced documents sent were malware binaries posing as legitimate files using the common right\u00adto\u00adleft filenames tactic in order to conceal the actual file extension. All of these techniques, while common pretexting mechanisms, are a refinement compared to a tendency amongst other groups to simply continually send different forms of generic malware or phishing, in the hopes that one would eventually be successful.",

APT 28 has been active since at least January 2007.\n\n(FireEye) APT28 likely seeks to collect intelligence about Georgia\u2019s security and political dynamics by targeting officials working for the Ministry of Internal Affairs and the Ministry of Defense.\n\nAPT28 has demonstrated interest in Eastern European governments and security organizations. These victims would provide the Russian government with an ability to predict policymaker intentions and gauge its ability to influence public opinion.\n\nAPT28 appeared to target individuals affiliated with European security organizations and global multilateral institutions. The Russian government has long cited European security organizations like NATO and the OSCE as existential threats, particularly during periods of increased tension in Europe.\n\nSofacy may be related to {{Hades}}, but it could be a false flag as well.",

Sowbug has been seen mounting classic espionage attacks by stealing documents from the organizations it infiltrates.\n\nSymantec saw the first evidence of Sowbug-related activity with the discovery in March 2017 of an entirely new piece of malware called Felismus used against a target in Southeast Asia.  We have subsequently identified further victims on both sides of the Pacific Ocean. While the Felismus tool was first identified in March of this year, its association with Sowbug was unknown until now. Symantec has also been able to connect earlier attack campaigns with Sowbug, demonstrating that it has been active since at least early-2015 and may have been operating even earlier.\n\nTo date, Sowbug appears to be focused mainly on government entities in South America and Southeast Asia and has infiltrated organizations in Argentina, Brazil, Ecuador, Peru, Brunei and Malaysia. The group is well resourced, capable of infiltrating multiple targets simultaneously and will often operate outside the working hours of targeted organizations in order to maintain a low profile.",

The main victims are political and military organizations in Egypt, Israel and possibly other countries.  Sensitive data theft is what the attackers plotted for during the period from June, 2014 to November, 2015 when the activity was in its prime. We encountered some timestamps of the samples to be as early as December, 2011 which suggests the attack might be started much earlier, though further sound proof is needed. The main approach of Sphinx is watering hole attack on social web sites. Until now, we have obtained 314 pieces of sample malicious codes and 7 C2 domains.",

While ransomware for Linux has existed for many years, BGH actors have historically not targeted Linux, much less ESXi specifically. ESXi is a type of hypervisor that runs on dedicated hardware and manages multiple virtual machines (VMs). With more organizations migrating to virtualization solutions to consolidate legacy IT systems, this is a natural target for ransomware operators looking to increase the impact against a victim.\n\nAll identified incidents were enabled by the acquisition of valid credentials. In four separate Defray777 incidents, SPRITE SPIDER used administrator credentials to log in through the vCenter web interface. In one instance, SPRITE SPIDER likely used the PyXie remote access trojan (RAT) LaZagne module to harvest vCenter administrator credentials stored in a web browser.\n\nBy targeting these hosts, ransomware operators are able to quickly encrypt multiple systems with relatively few actual ransomware deployments. Encrypting one ESXi server inflicts the same amount of damage as individually deploying ransomware on each VM hosted on a given server. Consequently, targeting ESXi hosts can also improve the speed of BGH operations. Additionally, due to their lack of conventional operating systems, ESXi hosts lack endpoint protection software that could prevent or detect ransomware attacks.",

            "description": "(Citizen Lab) This report describes a campaign of targeted spyware attacks carried out by a sophisticated operator, which we call Stealth Falcon. The attacks have been conducted from 2012 until the present, against Emirati journalists, activists, and dissidents. We discovered this campaign when an individual purporting to be from an apparently fictitious organization called \u201cThe Right to Fight\u201d contacted Rori Donaghy. Donaghy, a UK-based journalist and founder of the Emirates Center for Human Rights, received a spyware-laden email in November 2015, purporting to offer him a position on a human rights panel. Donaghy has written critically of the United Arab Emirates (UAE) government in the past, and had recently published a series of articles based on leaked emails involving members of the UAE government.\n\nCircumstantial evidence suggests a link between Stealth Falcon and the UAE government. We traced digital artifacts used in this campaign to links sent from an activist\u2019s Twitter account in December 2012, a period when it appears to have been under government control. We also identified other bait content employed by this threat actor. We found 31 public tweets sent by Stealth Falcon, 30 of which were directly targeted at one of 27 victims. Of the 27 targets, 24 were obviously linked to the UAE, based on their profile information (e.g., photos, \u201cUAE\u201d in account name, location), and at least six targets appeared to be operated by people who were arrested, sought for arrest, or convicted in absentia by the UAE government, in relation to their Twitter activity.",

Symantec obtained a sample of the group\u2019s Remsec malware from a customer who submitted it following its detection by our behavioral engine.\n\nRemsec is primarily designed to spy on targets. It opens a back door on an infected computer, can log keystrokes, and steal files.\n\nStrider has been highly selective in its choice of targets and, to date, Symantec has found evidence of infections in 36 computers across seven separate organizations. The group\u2019s targets include a number of organizations and individuals located in Russia, an airline in China, an organization in Sweden, and an embassy in Belgium.",

            "description": "(Symantec) In March 2016, Symantec published a blog on Suckfly, an advanced cyberespionage group that conducted attacks against a number of South Korean organizations to steal digital certificates. Since then we have identified a number of attacks over a two-year period, beginning in April 2014, which we attribute to Suckfly. The attacks targeted high-profile targets, including government and commercial organizations. These attacks occurred in several different countries, but our investigation revealed that the primary targets were individuals and organizations primarily located in India.\n\nWhile there have been several Suckfly campaigns that infected organizations with the group\u2019s custom malware Backdoor.Nidiran, the Indian targets show a greater amount of post-infection activity than targets in other regions. This suggests that these attacks were part of a planned operation against specific targets in India.",

Based on our research, SWEED \u2014 which has been operating since at least 2017 \u2014 primarily targets their victims with stealers and remote access trojans.\n\nSWEED remains consistent across most of their campaigns in their use of spear-phishing emails with malicious attachments. While these campaigns have featured a myriad of different types of malicious documents, the actor primarily tries to infect its victims with a packed version of Agent Tesla \u2014 an information stealer that\u2019s been around since at least 2014. The version of Agent Tesla that SWEED is using differs slightly from what we\u2019ve seen in the past in the way that it is packed, as well as how it infects the system. In this post, we\u2019ll run down each campaign we\u2019re able to connect to SWEED, and talk about some of the actor\u2019s tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs).",

In this attack, the actors placed droppers inside of ZIP archives, and then attached those ZIPs to emails. The attachments usually had file names similar to \u201cJava_Updater.zip\u201d or \u201cP-O of Jun2017.zip\u201d.\r\n**2018-01**: In early 2018, we observed that SWEED began leveraging Java-based droppers. Similar to previous campaigns, the JAR was directly attached to emails and used file names such as \u201cOrder_2018.jar\u201d. The purpose of the JAR was to obtain information about the infected system and facilitate the download of a packed version of Agent Tesla.\r\n**2018-04**: In April 2018, SWEED began making use of a previously disclosed Office exploit. One of the documents featured in these email campaigns was notable because it was a PowerPoint document (PPXS). Code contained inside one of the slides triggers an exploit for CVE-2017-8759, a remote code execution vulnerability in Microsoft .NET framework.\r\n**2018-05**: In May 2018, campaigns being conducted by SWEED began leveraging another vulnerability in Microsoft Office: CVE-2017-11882, a remote code execution bug in Microsoft Office that is commonly observed being leveraged in malicious documents used in commodity malware distribution.\r\n**2019**: Beginning in 2019, the campaigns associated with SWEED began leveraging malicious Office macros. As with previous attacks, they are leveraging spear-phishing emails and malicious attachments to initiate the infection process.\nhttps://blog.talosintelligence.com/2019/07/sweed-agent-tesla.html\r\n",

In May 5, 2011 the Syrian Computer Society registered SEA\u2019s website (syrian-es.com). Because Syria's domain registration authority registered the hacker site, some security experts have written that the group was supervised by the Syrian state. SEA claimed on its webpage to be no official entity, but 'a group of enthusiastic Syrian youths who could not stay passive towards the massive distortion of facts about the recent uprising in Syria'. As soon as May 27, 2011 SEA had removed text that denied it was an official entity. On the new page, the description of 'not an official entity' was removed, only says that it was established by a group of young Syrian enthusiasts to combat the use of the Internet, especially people that use of Facebook in Syria to 'spread hatred' and 'destroy peace'.\n\nThe Syrian Electronic Army uses spam, website defacement, malware, phishing and denial of service attacks against political opposition groups, Western news agencies, human rights groups and seemingly neutral websites for Syrian conflicts. It also attacked government websites in the Middle East and Europe as well as US defense contractors. The Syrian Electronic Army is the first Arab organization to set up a public Internet army on its national network to openly launch cyber-attacks on its enemies.\n\nSyrian Electronic Army has 2 subgroups:\n1. {{Subgroup: Goldmouse, APT-C-27}}\n2. {{Subgroup: Pat Bear, APT-C-37}}",

The actor, known as TA2552, uses well-crafted Spanish language lures that leverage a narrow range of themes and brands. The lures entice users to click a link in the message, taking them to the legitimate Microsoft third-party apps consent page. There they are prompted to grant a third-party application read-only user permissions to their O365 account via OAuth2 or other token-based authorization methods. TA2552 seeks access to specific account resources like the user\u2019s contacts and mail. Requesting read-only permissions for such account resources could be used to conduct account reconnaissance, silently steal data, or to intercept password reset messages from other accounts such as those at financial institutions. While organizations with global presence have received messages from this group, they appear to choose recipients who are likely Spanish speakers.",

            "description": "(Proofpoint) Beginning in the first half of 2020, the rapid international spread of the COVID-19 virus introduced a shift within the threat landscape towards pandemic-themed social engineering lures. Public research has noted several Chinese APT groups adopting COVID-19 phishing lures in recent months to carry out espionage campaigns against established and expanding target sets. In March 2020, Proofpoint researchers observed a phishing campaign impersonating the World Health Organization\u2019s (WHO) guidance on COVID-19 critical preparedness to deliver a new malware family that researchers have dubbed \u201cSepulcher\u201d. This campaign targeted European diplomatic and legislative bodies, non-profit policy research organizations, and global organizations dealing with economic affairs.  Additionally, a sender email identified in this campaign has been linked to historic Chinese APT targeting of the international Tibetan community using payloads linked to LuckyCat malware. Subsequently, a phishing campaign from July 2020 targeting Tibetan dissidents was identified delivering the same strain of Sepulcher malware. Operator email accounts identified in this campaign have been publicly linked to historic Chinese APT campaigns targeting the Tibetan community delivering ExileRAT malware. Based on the use of publicly known sender addresses associated with Tibetan dissident targeting and the delivery of Sepulcher malware payloads, Proofpoint researchers have attributed both campaigns to the APT actor TA413, which has previously been documented in association with ExileRAT. The usage of publicly known Tibetan-themed sender accounts to deliver Sepulcher malware demonstrates a short-term realignment of TA413\u2019s targets of interest. While best known for their campaigns against the Tibetan diaspora, this APT group associated with the Chinese state interest prioritized intelligence collection around Western economies reeling from COVID-19 in March 2020 before resuming more conventional targeting later this year.\n\nAn overlap in infrastructure has been observed with {{Lucky Cat}}.",

            "description": "(Proofpoint) Proofpoint researchers initially identified email campaigns with malicious RTF document attachments targeting East Asian government agencies in March 2019. These campaigns originated from adversary-operated free email sender accounts at yahoo[.]co[.].jp and yahoo[.]com. Sender addresses often imitated common names found in the languages of targeted entities. Spear phishing emails included malicious .doc attachments that were actually RTF files saved with .doc file extensions.\n\nThe lures used in the subjects, attachment names, and attachment content in several cases utilized information technology themes specific to Asia such as governmental or public training documents relating to IT. On one specific occasion an email utilized the subject \u201cITU Asia-Pacific Online CoE Training Course on \u2018Conformity & Interoperability in 5G\u2019 for the Asia-Pacific Region, 15-26 April 2019\u201d and the attachment name \u201c190315_annex 1 online_course_agenda_coei_c&i.doc\u201d. The conference referenced in the lure was an actual event likely selected due to its relevance to potential victims. This is significant as countries in the APAC region continue to adopt Chinese 5G technology in government as well as heavy equipment industries.\n\nThis actor worked together with {{Emissary Panda, APT 27, LuckyMouse, Bronze Union}} in Operation StealthyTrident.",

Where possible, we detail the affiliate models with which they are involved and outline the current state of TA505 campaigns.\n\nTA505 is arguably one of the most significant financially motivated threat actors because of the extraordinary volumes of messages they send. The variety of malware delivered by the group also demonstrates their deep connections to the underground malware scene. At the time of writing, Locky ransomware remains their malware of choice, even as the group continues to experiment with a variety of additional malware.\n\nMuch of the malware from TA505 has been observed to be distributed using {{Avalanche}}, Cutwail (operated by {{Narwhal Spider}}), Necurs (operated by {{Monty Spider}}) and Emotet (operated by {{Mummy Spider, TA542}}).\n\nTA505 also has some infrastructure overlap with {{Buhtrap, Ratopak Spider}} and Group-IB found several relationships with {{Silence, Contract Crew}}.\n\nThe Dridex development appears to have been done by a subgroup named {{Indrik Spider}} and, by extension, {{Doppel Spider}}.\n\nSee also: {{Dungeon Spider}} and {{FIN11}}.",

For example, intended victims frequently have titles of Chief Financial Officer, Head of Finance, Senior Vice President, Director and other high level roles.\n\nAdditionally, TA530 customizes the email to each target by specifying the target\u2019s name, job title, phone number, and company name in the email body, subject, and attachment names. On several occasions, we verified that these details are correct for the intended victim. While we do not know for sure the source of these details, they frequently appear on public websites, such as LinkedIn or the company\u2019s own website. The customization doesn't end with the lure; the malware used in the campaigns is also targeted by region and vertical.",

            "description": "(Trend Micro) The Taidoor attackers have been actively engaging in targeted attacks since at least March 4, 2009. Despite some exceptions, the Taidoor campaign often used Taiwanese IP addresses as C&C servers and email addresses to send out socially engineered emails with malware as attachments. One of the primary targets of the Taidoor campaign appeared to be the Taiwanese government. The attackers spoofed Taiwanese government email addresses to send out socially engineered emails in the Chinese language that typically leveraged Taiwan-themed issues. The attackers actively sent out malicious documents and maintained several IP addresses for command and control.\n\nAs part of their social engineering ploy, the Taidoor attackers attach a decoy document to their emails that, when opened, displays the contents of a legitimate document but executes a malicious payload in the background.\n\nWe were only able to gather a limited amount of information regarding the Taidoor attackers\u2019 activities after they have compromised a target. We did, however, find that the Taidoor malware allowed attackers to operate an interactive shell on compromised computers and to upload and download files. In order to determine the operational capabilities of the attackers behind the Taidoor campaign, we monitored a compromised honeypot. The attackers issued out some basic commands in an attempt to map out the extent of the network compromise but quickly realized that the honeypot was not an intended targeted and so promptly disabled the Taidoor malware running on it. This indicated that while Taidoor malware were more widely distributed compared with those tied to other targeted campaigns, the attackers could quickly assess their targets and distinguish these from inadvertently compromised computers and honeypots.",

Known as the TeamSpy crew because of its affinity for using the legitimate TeamViewer application as part of its toolset, the attackers may have been active for as long as 10 years, researchers say.\n\nThe attack appears to be a years-long espionage campaign, but experts who have analyzed the victim profile, malware components and command-and-control infrastructure say that it\u2019s not entirely clear what kind of data the attackers are going after. What is clear, though, is that the attackers have been at this for a long time and that they have specific people in mind as targets.\n\nResearchers at the CrySyS Lab in Hungary were alerted by the Hungarian National Security Authority to an attack against a high-profile target in the country and began looking into the campaign. They quickly discovered that some of the infrastructure being used in the attack had been in use for some time and that the target they were investigating was by no means the only one.",

If the C2 is active, it will provide what is effectively a piece of shellcode, encrypted by another 32-bit constant.

Further investigation revealed that the campaign has been actively distributing their RAT component to their targets in 2011 and the first half of 2012. Furthermore, we uncovered one malware component that dates back to November 2009. This indicates that the campaign started during that time or earlier.\n\nThe HeartBeat campaign appears to target government organizations and institutions or communities that are in some way related to the South Korean government. Specifically, we were able to identify the following targets:\n\n\u2022 Political parties\n\u2022 Media outfits\n\u2022 A national policy research institute\n\u2022 A military branch of South Korean armed forces\n\u2022 A small business sector organization\n\u2022 Branches of South Korean government\n\nThe profile of their targets suggests that the motive behind the campaign may be politically motivated.\n\n(Kaspersky) The actor has quite likely relied on much the same codebase and implant variants for the past six years. However these have broadened substantially since 2018. The group spear-phishes its targets, deploys Word and Equation Editor exploits and an appropriated/repackaged {{DarkHotel}} VBScript zero-day, delivers modified and compiled unique Mimikatz variants, GSEC and WCE credential stealers, a keylogger, various Escalation of Privilege exploits, various older utilities and an updated set of backdoors, and what appear to be new variants of custom downloader and backdoor modules.",

Our investigation began with malicious emails sent to Indian embassies in Saudi Arabia and Kazakstan but turned up connections to watering hole sites focused on Indian military personnel and designed to drop a remote access Trojan (RAT) with a variety of data exfiltration functions. Our analysis shows that many of the campaigns and attacks appear related by common IOCs, vectors, payloads, and language, but the exact nature and attribution associated with this APT remain under investigation.\nAt this time, the background and analysis in this paper provide useful forensics and detail our current thinking on the malware that we have dubbed \u201cMSIL/Crimson\u201d.\n\nTransparent Tribe may be related to {{Gorgon Group}}.\n\nTransparant Tribe has been observed to use the Andromeda botnet (operated by {{Andromeda Spider}}).",

The attackers behind Epic Turla have infected several hundred computers in more than 45 countries, including government institutions, embassies, military, education, research and pharmaceutical companies.\nhttps://securelist.com/the-epic-turla-operation/65545/\r\n**2014**: Breach of the Swiss military firm RUAG\nhttps://www.melani.admin.ch/melani/en/home/dokumentation/reports/technical-reports/technical-report_apt_case_ruag.html\r\n**2014-12**: Operation \u201cPenguin Turla\u201d\nThe Turla APT campaigns have a broader reach than initially anticipated after the recent discovery of two modules built to infect servers running Linux. Until now, every Turla sample in captivity was designed for either 32- or 64-bit Windows systems, but researchers at Kaspersky Lab have discovered otherwise.\nhttps://threatpost.com/linux-modules-connected-to-turla-apt-discovered/109765/\r\n**2015**: Operation \u201cSatellite Turla\u201d\nObviously, such incredibly apparent and large-scale attacks have little chance of surviving for long periods of time, which is one of the key requirements for running an APT operation. It is therefore not very feasible to perform the attack through MitM traffic hijacking, unless the attackers have direct control over some high-traffic network points, such as backbone routers or fiber optics. There are signs that such attacks are becoming more common, but there is a much simpler way to hijack satellite-based Internet traffic.\nhttps://securelist.com/satellite-turla-apt-command-and-control-in-the-sky/72081/\r\n**2015**: Operation \u201cWITCHCOVEN\u201d\nWhen an unsuspecting user visits any of the over 100 compromised websites, a small piece of inserted code\u2014embedded in the site\u2019s HTML and invisible to casual visitors\u2014quietly redirects the user\u2019s browser to a second compromised website without the user\u2019s knowledge. This second website hosts the WITCHCOVEN script, which uses profiling techniques to collect technical information on the user\u2019s computer. As of early November 2015, we identified a total of 14 websites hosting the WITCHCOVEN profiling script.\nhttps://www2.fireeye.com/rs/848-DID-242/images/rpt-witchcoven.pdf\r\n**2015**: ESET researchers found a previously undocumented backdoor and document stealer. Dubbed Crutch by its developers, we were able to attribute it to the infamous Turla APT group. According to our research, it was used from 2015 to, at least, early 2020.\nhttps://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/12/02/turla-crutch-keeping-back-door-open/\r\n**2016-11**: Operation \u201cSkipper Turla\u201d\nOn 28 January 2017, John Lambert of Microsoft (@JohnLaTwC) tweeted about a malicious document that dropped a \u201cvery interesting .JS backdoor\u201c. Since the end of November 2016, Kaspersky Lab has observed Turla using this new JavaScript payload and specific macro variant.\nhttps://securelist.com/kopiluwak-a-new-javascript-payload-from-turla/77429/\nhttps://securelist.com/introducing-whitebear/81638/\r\n**2017**: Operation \u201cTurla Mosquito\u201d\nESET researchers have observed a significant change in the campaign of the infamous espionage group\nhttps://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/05/22/turla-mosquito-shift-towards-generic-tools/\r\n**2017-03**: New versions of Carbon\nThe Turla espionage group has been targeting various institutions for many years. Recently, we found several new versions of Carbon, a second stage backdoor in the Turla group arsenal.\nhttps://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/03/30/carbon-paper-peering-turlas-second-stage-backdoor/\r\n**2017-05**: New backdoor Kazuar\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/unit42-kazuar-multiplatform-espionage-backdoor-api-access/\r\n**2017-06**: Some of the tactics used in APT attacks die hard. A good example is provided by Turla\u2019s watering hole campaigns. Turla, which has been targeting governments, government officials and diplomats for years \u2013 see, as an example, this recent paper \u2013 is still using watering hole techniques to redirect potentially interesting victims to their C&C infrastructure. In fact, they have been using them since at least 2014 with very few variations in their modus operandi.\nhttps://www.welivesecurity.com/2017/06/06/turlas-watering-hole-campaign-updated-firefox-extension-abusing-instagram/\r\n**2017-07**: Russian malware link hid in a comment on Britney Spears\u2019 Instagram\nThe Slovak IT security company ESET Security released a report yesterday detailing a cleverly hidden example of such a post. And its hideout? A Britney Spears photo. Among the nearly 7,000 comments written on the performer\u2019s post (shown below) was one that could easily pass as spam.\nhttps://www.engadget.com/2017/06/07/russian-malware-hidden-britney-spears-instagram/\r\n**2017-08**: New backdoor Gazer\nhttps://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/eset-gazer.pdf\r\n**2017-08**: In this case, the dropper is being delivered with a benign and possibly stolen decoy document inviting recipients to a G20 task force meeting on the \u201cDigital Economy\u201d. The Digital Economy event is actually scheduled for October of this year in Hamburg, Germany.\nhttps://www.proofpoint.com/us/threat-insight/post/turla-apt-actor-refreshes-kopiluwak-javascript-backdoor-use-g20-themed-attack\r\n**2018-01**: A notorious hacking group is targeting the UK with an updated version of malware designed to embed itself into compromised networks and stealthily conduct espionage.\nBoth the Neuron and Nautilus malware variants have previously been attributed to the Turla advanced persistent threat group, which regularly carries out cyber-espionage against a range of targets, including government, military, technology, energy, and other commercial organisations.\nhttps://www.zdnet.com/article/this-hacking-gang-just-updated-the-malware-it-uses-against-uk-targets/\r\n**2018-01**: Espionage Group Rolls Out Brand-New Toolset in Attacks Against Governments\nWaterbug may have hijacked a separate espionage group\u2019s infrastructure during one attack against a Middle Eastern target.\nhttps://www.symantec.com/blogs/threat-intelligence/waterbug-espionage-governments\r\n**2018-03**: Starting in March 2018, we observed a significant change in the campaign: it now leverages the open source exploitation framework Metasploit before dropping the custom Mosquito backdoor.\nhttps://www.welivesecurity.com/2018/05/22/turla-mosquito-shift-towards-generic-tools/\r\n**2018**: Much of our 2018 research focused on Turla\u2019s KopiLuwak javascript backdoor, new variants of the Carbon framework and meterpreter delivery techniques. Also interesting was Mosquito\u2019s changing delivery techniques, customized PoshSec-Mod open-source powershell use, and borrowed injector code. We tied some of this activity together with infrastructure and data points from WhiteBear and Mosquito infrastructure and activity in 2017 and 2018.\nhttps://securelist.com/shedding-skin-turlas-fresh-faces/88069/\r\n**2019 Early**: 2019 has seen the Turla actor actively renew its arsenal. Its developers are still using a familiar coding style, but they\u2019re creating new tools. Here we\u2019ll tell you about several of them, namely \u201cTopinambour\u201d (aka Sunchoke \u2013 the Jerusalem artichoke) and its related modules. We didn\u2019t choose to name it after a vegetable; the .NET malware developers named it Topinambour themselves.\nhttps://securelist.com/turla-renews-its-arsenal-with-topinambour/91687/\r\n**2019-04**: COMpfun successor Reductor infects files on the fly to compromise TLS traffic\nhttps://securelist.com/compfun-successor-reductor/93633/\r\n**2019-05**: Turla, also known as Snake, is an infamous espionage group recognized for its complex malware. To confound detection, its operators recently started using PowerShell scripts that provide direct, in-memory loading and execution of malware executables and libraries. This allows them to bypass detection that can trigger when a malicious executable is dropped on disk.\nhttps://www.welivesecurity.com/2019/05/29/turla-powershell-usage/\r\n**2019**: Turla accessed and used the Command and Control (C2) infrastructure of Iranian APTs to deploy their own tools to victims of interest. Turla directly accessed \u2018Poison Frog\u2019 C2 panels from their own infrastructure and used this access to task victims to download additional tools.\nhttps://www.ncsc.gov.uk/news/turla-group-exploits-iran-apt-to-expand-coverage-of-victims\r\n**2019-09**: ESET researchers found a watering hole (aka strategic web compromise) operation targeting several high-profile Armenian websites. It relies on a fake Adobe Flash update lure and delivers two previously undocumented pieces of malware we have dubbed NetFlash and PyFlash.\nhttps://www.welivesecurity.com/2020/03/12/tracking-turla-new-backdoor-armenian-watering-holes/\r\n**2019-11**: COMpfun authors spoof visa application with HTTP status-based Trojan\nhttps://securelist.com/compfun-http-status-based-trojan/96874/\r\n**2020-01**: During our investigation, we were able to identify three different targets where ComRAT v4 has been used:\n\u2022 Two Ministries of Foreign Affairs in Eastern Europe\n\u2022 One national parliament in the Caucasus region\nhttps://www.welivesecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/ESET_Turla_ComRAT.pdf\r\n**2020-06**: At the best of our knowledge, this time the hacking group used a previously unseen implant, that we internally named \u201cNewPass\u201c as one of the parameters used to send exfiltrated data to the command and control.\nhttps://www.telsy.com/turla-venomous-bear-updates-its-arsenal-newpass-appears-on-the-apt-threat-scene/\r\n**2020-06**: Accenture Cyber Threat Intelligence researchers identified a Turla compromise of a European government organization. During this compromise Turla utilized a combination of remote procedure call (RPC)-based backdoors, such as HyperStack and remote administration trojans (RATs), such as Kazuar and Carbon, which ACTI researchers analyzed between June and October 2020.\nhttps://www.accenture.com/us-en/blogs/cyber-defense/turla-belugasturgeon-compromises-government-entity\r\n**2021-02**: IronNetInjector: Turla\u2019s New Malware Loading Tool\nhttps://unit42.paloaltonetworks.com/ironnetinjector/\r\n",

Even though new attacks were detected at the time, part of the group's infrastructure remained active and some sites were still infected. The cybercriminals did not use existing domains for new attacks but switched to a new infrastructure to store malicious code and collect intercepted payment data.",

After further investigation, Dragos observed WASSONITE tools and behaviors targeting multiple industrial control system (ICS) entities including electric generation, nuclear energy, manufacturing, and organizations involved in space-centric research. WASSONITE has been active since at least 2018.\n\nWASSONITE targeting focuses on Asian entities, largely in India, as well as possibly Japan and South Korea. At this time, WASSONITE does not appear to have an ICS-specific disruptive or destructive capability. All the activity represents Stage 1 ICS kill-chain: access operations within IT networks.\n\nWASSONITE operations rely on deploying DTrack malware for remote access to victim machines, capturing credentials via Mimikatz and publicly available tools, and utilizing system tools to transfer files and move laterally within the enterprise system. Researchers first disclosed DTrack in late September 2019, and identified the tool targeting Indian financial institutions and research centers. DTrack is loosely connected to an earlier observed malware family, ATMDTrack, used for robbing ATM machines.\n\nThird-party security firms associate DTrack and its related malware to the {{Lazarus Group, Hidden Cobra, Labyrinth Chollima}}. Dragos also associates the activity group {{Covellite}} to Lazarus Group. However, while COVELLITE is also linked to broader Lazarus activity, this group leveraged substantially different capabilities and infrastructure to pursue a target set that does not overlap with observed WASSONITE activity.",

Chances are about even, though, that Mofang is a relevant threat actor to any organization that invests in Myanmar or is otherwise politically involved.

It has attacked multi-billion dollar companies operating in the internet, IT software, pharmaceutical, and commodities sectors. Twitter, Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft are among the companies who have publicly acknowledged attacks.\n\nButterfly is technically proficient and well resourced. The group has developed a suite of custom malware tools capable of attacking both Windows and Apple computers, and appears to have used at least one zero-day vulnerability in its attacks. It keeps a low profile and maintains good operational security. After successfully compromising a target organization, it cleans up after itself before moving on to its next target.\n\nThis group operates at a much higher level than the average cybercrime gang. It is not interested in stealing credit card details or customer databases and is instead focused on high-level corporate information. Butterfly may be selling this information to the highest bidder or may be operating as hackers for hire. Stolen information could also be used for insider-trading purposes.",

In fact, we found just three almost unique samples, all in one country. So we consider the attacks to be targeted and have currently named this operation WildPressure.",

            "description": "Winnti Group is a threat group with Chinese origins that has been active since at least 2010. The group has heavily targeted the gaming industry, but it has also expanded the scope of its targeting. Some reporting suggests a number of other groups, including {{APT 41}}, {{Axiom, Group 72}}, {{APT 17, Deputy Dog, Elderwood, Sneaky Panda}}, and {{Ke3chang, Vixen Panda, APT 15, GREF, Playful Dragon}}, are closely linked to or overlap with Winnti Group.\n\n(Trend Micro) The group behind the Winnti malware (which we will call the Winnti group for brevity) sprung up as a band of traditional cyber crooks, comprising black hats whose technical skills were employed to perpetrate financial fraud. Based on the use of domain names they registered, the group started out in the business of fake/rogue anti-virus products in 2007. In 2009, the Winnti group shifted to targeting gaming companies in South Korea using a self-named data- and file-stealing malware.\n\nThe group, which was primarily motivated by profit, is noted for utilizing self-developed technically-proficient tools for their attacks. They once attacked a game server to illicitly farm in-game currency (\u201cgaming gold\u201d, which also has real-world value) and stole source codes of online game projects. The group also engaged in the theft of digital certificates which they then used to sign their malware to make them stealthier. The Winnti group diversified its targets to include enterprises such as those in pharmaceutics and telecommunications. The group has since earned infamy for being involved in malicious activities associated with targeted attacks, such as deploying spear-phishing campaigns and building a backdoor.",

It emerged that the piece of malware landed on users\u2019 computers as part of a regular update from the game\u2019s official update server. Some even suspected that the publisher itself was spying on players. However, it later became clear that the malicious program ended up on the users\u2019 computers by mistake: the cybercriminals were in fact targeting the companies that develop and release computer games.\nhttps://securelist.com/winnti-more-than-just-a-game/37029/\r\n**2011**: For example, by 2011, one of their victims was Gameforge, a company that offers so-called freemium games: while playing the games is free, it is possible to buy virtual items/money with real money.The Winnti hackers were able to directly access Gameforge\u2019s databases and modify accounts to become \u2018virtually\u2019 richer.\nhttps://media.cert.europa.eu/static/MEMO/2019/TLP-WHITE-CERT-EU-MEMO-190725-1.pdf\r\n**2014 Summer**: The Winnti hackers broke into Henkel\u2019s network in 2014.

It is considered unsophisticated by the fact that the scripts are unobtrusive, communications go unencrypted by HTTP, they use Powershell (increasingly monitored), and so on. Despite this apparently unsophisticated modus operandi compared to other actors, they manage to infect their victims and carry out their objectives. In addition, as will be seen during the report, the detection rate of some of the scripts in December 2018 by the main antivirus manufacturers is low, an aspect that must be highlighted. We must be aware that once these scripts are executed, it is when the behavior analysis of many solutions will detect them, but this fact has not been studied by LAB52.\n\nThis actor in all the artifacts analyzed shows his victims a decoy document in Arabic with different themes.",

It has attracted very little public attention, with the exception of an advisory from the Belarusian CERT in February 2020. In the interim, the group compromised many government agencies and private companies in Eastern Europe and the Balkans.\n\nIn this paper, we present our analysis of this nine-year-long espionage campaign, active since 2011, but which apparently went dark in February 2020.\n\nWith its primary purpose seemingly being cyber espionage, this group stole documents and other sensitive files, such as victims\u2019 mailboxes. These outcomes were achieved through the use of the XDSpy malware ecosystem, composed of at least seven components: XDDown, XDRecon, XDList, XDMonitor, XDUpload, XDLoc and XDPass. As our research has not uncovered links with any previously known APT groups, we have attributed this malware toolset to a previously unknown group.",

            "description": "(Palo Alto) Between May and June 2019, Unit 42 observed previously unknown tools used in the targeting of transportation and shipping organizations based in Kuwait.\n\nThe first known attack in this campaign targeted a Kuwait transportation and shipping company in which the actors installed a backdoor tool named Hisoka. Several custom tools were later downloaded to the system in order to carry out post-exploitation activities. All of these tools appear to have been created by the same developer. We were able to collect several variations of these tools including one dating back to July 2018.\n\nThe developer of the collected tools used character names from the anime series Hunter x Hunter, which is the basis for the campaign name \u201cxHunt.\u201d The names of the tools collected include backdoor tools Sakabota, Hisoka, Netero and Killua. These tools not only use HTTP for their command and control (C2) channels, but certain variants of these tools use DNS tunneling or emails to communicate with their C2 as well. While DNS tunneling as a C2 channel is fairly common, the specific method in which this group used email to facilitate C2 communications has not been observed by Unit 42 in quite some time. This method uses Exchange Web Services (EWS) and stolen credentials to create email \u201cdrafts\u201d to communicate between the actor and the tool. In addition to the aforementioned backdoor tools, we also observed tools referred to as Gon and EYE, which provide the backdoor access and the ability to carry out post-exploitation activities.",

After analyzing and investigating the documents we conclude that they are authentic. Consequently, this causes considerable harm to the groups and their operation. The identity of the actor behind the leak is currently unknown, however based on the scope and the quality of the exposed documents and information, it appears that they are professional and highly capable. This leak will likely hamstring the groups\u2019 operation in the near future. Accordingly, in our assessment this will minimize the risk of potential attacks in the next few months and possibly even year. Note \u2013most of the leaks are posted on Telegram channels that were created specifically for this purpose.\n\nUnlike the previous two channels this has been around for a long time. On Friday May 5th, dozens of confidential documents labeled as \u201csecret\u201d (a high confidentiality level in Iran, one before the highest \u2013top secret) were posted on this channel. The documents were related to Iranian attack groups\u2019 activity.\n\nUpdate: this leak may have been the work of the {{CIA}}.",

            "description": "(Virus Bulletin) Andromeda, also known as Gamaru and Wauchos, is a modular and HTTP-based botnet that was discovered in late 2011. From that point on, it managed to survive and continue hardening by evolving in different ways. In particular, the complexity of its loader and AV evasion methods increased repeatedly, and C&C communication changed between the different versions as well.\n\nWe deal with versions of this threat on a daily basis and we have collected a number of different variants. The botnet first came onto our tracking radar at version 2.06, and we have tracked the versions since then. In this paper we will describe the evolution of Andromeda from version 2.06 to 2.10 and demonstrate both how it has improved its loader to evade automatic analysis/detection and how the payload varies among the different versions.\n\nThis article could also be seen as a way to say 'goodbye' to the botnet: a takedown effort, followed by the arrest of the suspected botnet owner in December 2017, may mean we have seen the last of the botnet that has plagued Internet users for more than half a decade.\n\nThe Andromeda botnet has been observed to be used by {{Transparent Tribe, APT 36}}.",

But in campaigns from July to August 2020, the group deployed Monero coin miners in attacks that targeted both the private sector and government institutions in France and Vietnam.\nBecause BISMUTH\u2019s attacks involved techniques that ranged from typical to more advanced, devices with common threat activities like phishing and coin mining should be elevated and inspected for advanced threats. More importantly, organizations should prioritize reducing attack surface and hardening networks against the full range of attacks.

            "description": "(IBM) When it comes to discovering new malware, it is much more common for researchers to run across information stealers, ransomware and remote-access tools (RATs) than it is to encounter brand new complex codes like banking Trojans or targeted attack tools such as Duqu.\n\nNonetheless, it is the lesser breeds, like information stealers and RATs, that are a lot more prolific in the wild. And while banking Trojans or targeted attacks are quite specific in what they do, information stealers are by far less discriminatory and thus end up affecting a greater number of people and organizations.\n\nThat brings us to CoreBot, a new information stealer discovered and analyzed by IBM Security X-Force researchers, who indicate this is one malware piece to watch out for. CoreBot appears to be quite modular, which means that its structure and internal makeup were programmed in a way that allows for the easy adding of new data theft and endpoint control mechanisms.\n\nCoreBot was discovered while the researchers were studying the activity of malware on Trusteer-protected enterprise endpoints. The malware\u2019s compiled file was named \u201ccore\u201d by its developer. Antivirus engines do not specify this malware\u2019s name yet and detect it under generic names such as Dynamer!ac or Eldorado. But while CoreBot may appear artless at first glance, without real-time theft capabilities, it is more interesting on the inside.\n\nCoreBot has been observed to be distributed by DinaBot (operated by {{Scully Spider, TA547}}).",

Circles is affiliated with NSO Group, which develops the oft-abused Pegasus spyware.\n\nCircles, whose products work without hacking the phone itself, says they sell only to nation-states. According to leaked documents, Circles customers can purchase a system that they connect to their local telecommunications companies\u2019 infrastructure, or can use a separate system called the \u201cCircles Cloud,\u201d which interconnects with telecommunications companies around the world.\n\nAccording to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, all U.S. wireless networks are vulnerable to the types of weaknesses reportedly exploited by Circles. A majority of networks around the globe are similarly vulnerable.\n\nUsing Internet scanning, we found a unique signature associated with the hostnames of Check Point firewalls used in Circles deployments. This scanning enabled us to identify Circles deployments in at least 25 countries.\n\nWhile companies selling exploitation of the global cellular system tend to operate in secrecy, one company has emerged as a known player: Circles. The company was reportedly founded in 2008, acquired in 2014 by Francisco Partners, and then merged with NSO Group.

            "description": "(MEMRI) On September 18, 2012, the Qassam Cyber Fighters (QCF) posted its first message, in both English and Arabic, on its Pastebin page; the message warned the world that it was now targeting U.S. banks for hacking attacks, and would do so in the future as well.\n\nSince its emergence, the group has vowed to continue to carry out cyber attacks against Western targets until YouTube removes the anti-Muslim video 'Innocence of Muslims,' stating in its first communiqu\u00e9: 'All the Muslim youths who are active in the Cyber world will attack to American and Zionist bases as much as needed such that they say that they are sorry about that insult.'\n\nSince the September 18, 2012 message, in which it announced that it was planning to attack the Bank of America and New York Stock Exchange on that date, it has been widely speculated that the group's origins are in fact Iranian. Western media sources, as well as analysts who have studied the QCF, have stated that it is actually an Iranian front. Cyber security analyst Dancho Danchev performed the most authoritative open-source intelligence (OSINT) analysis on the issue of the group's links to Iran, aimed at exposing one of the individuals in the group, while former Senator Joseph I. Lieberman told C-Span that he believed that Iran's government was sponsoring the group's attacks on U.S. banks in retaliation for Western economic sanctions. Additionally, The New York Times quoted unnamed U.S. intelligence officials stating that the 'group is a convenient cover for Iran.'\n\nThe QCF claims to have attacked Bank of America, the New York Stock Exchange, Capital One Financial Corp, SunTrust Banks Inc., BB&T, HSBC, JPMorgan Chase & CO, PNC Financial Services, U.S. Bancorp, Citigroup Citibank, Wells Fargo & Company, Ally Financial, Fifth Third Bancorp, Zions Bancorporation, Union Bank, Comerica, Citizens Bank, Umpqua Bank, People's United Bank, University Federal Credit Union, Patelco Credit Union, American Express, KeyCorp, Ameriprise Financial, Citizens Financial, BBVA Compass, UMB Financial Corporation, M&T Bank, Bank of the West, Regions Financial Corp, Euronext, and Synovus Financial Corporation.",

They don\u2019t deploy ransomware, steal payment information to resell it, or engage in any type of activity commonly associated with the cybercrime underworld. Their interest in gathering sensitive business information leads us to believe that DeathStalker is a group of mercenaries offering hacking-for-hire services, or acting as some sort of information broker in financial circles.\n\nDeathStalker first came to our attention through a PowerShell-based implant called Powersing.

The company has been criticized for selling these capabilities to authoritarian governments \u2013 an allegation it has consistently denied.\n\nWhen the tables turned in July 2015, with Hacking Team itself suffering a damaging hack, the reported use of RCS by oppressive regimes was confirmed. With 400GB of internal data \u2013 including the once-secret list of customers, internal communications, and spyware source code \u2013 leaked online, Hacking Team was forced to request its customers to suspend all use of RCS, and was left facing an uncertain future.\n\nFollowing the hack, the security community has been keeping a close eye on the company\u2019s efforts to get back on its feet. The first reports suggesting Hacking Team\u2019s resumed operations came six months later \u2013 a new sample of Hacking Team\u2019s Mac spyware was apparently in the wild. A year after the breach, an investment by a company named Tablem Limited brought changes to Hacking Team\u2019s shareholder structure, with Tablem Limited taking 20% of Hacking Team\u2019s shareholding. Tablem Limited is officially based in Cyprus; however, recent news suggests it has ties to Saudi Arabia.",

Unlike most botnets, Necurs stands out due to its technical complexity, partnership diversity and continued evolution in an era when even the most complex malicious infrastructures can no longer withstand disruption.\n\nIn the past year alone, we have seen Necurs take on various roles. Linked with the spam distribution of the Dridex gang, it is used to spread one of the world\u2019s most nefarious banking Trojans. It also moved to mass distributing Locky, Dridex\u2019s ransomware child, then added distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks. Most recently, Necurs moved to pump-and-dump stock scam distribution before returning to spreading millions of Dridex-laden spam emails a day.\n\nNecurs has been observed to distribute Dridex ({{Indrik Spider}}) Locky ({{Dungeon Spider}}), TrickBot ({{Wizard Spider, Gold Blackburn}}) and much of the malware from {{TA505, Graceful Spider, Gold Evergreen}}.",

            "description": "(Crowdstrike) Mummy Spider is a criminal entity linked to the core development of the malware most commonly known as Emotet or Geodo. First observed in mid-2014, this malware shared code with the Bugat (aka Feodo) banking Trojan. However, Mummy Spider swiftly developed the malware\u2019s capabilities to include an RSA key exchange for command and control (C2) communication and a modular architecture.\n\nMummy Spider does not follow typical criminal behavioral patterns. In particular, Mummy Spider usually conducts attacks for a few months before ceasing operations for a period of between three and 12 months, before returning with a new variant or version.\n\nAfter a 10 month hiatus, Mummy Spider returned Emotet to operation in December 2016 but the latest variant is not deploying a banking Trojan module with web injects, it is currently acting as a \u2018loader\u2019 delivering other malware packages. The primary modules perform reconnaissance on victim machines, drop freeware tools for credential collection from web browsers and mail clients and a spam plugin for self-propagation. The malware is also issuing commands to download and execute other malware families such as the banking Trojans Dridex and Qakbot.\n\nMummy Spider advertised Emotet on underground forums until 2015, at which time it became private. Therefore, it is highly likely that Emotet is operated solely for use by Mummy Spider or with a small trusted group of customers.\n\nEmotet has been observed to distribute BokBot ({{Lunar Spider}}), Dridex ({{Indrik Spider}}), DoppelPaymer ({{Doppel Spider}}), Zeus Panda ({{Bamboo Spider, TA544}}) and Trickbot ({{Wizard Spider, Gold Blackburn}}), as well as QakBot ({{Mallard Spider}}).",

However this operation is not about stealing company resources or altering Linux\u2019s source code as we will unveil throughout the report.\n\nThe complexity of the backdoors deployed by the malicious actors shows out of the ordinary knowledge of operating systems and programming. Additionally, extra care was given to ensure portability, meaning the various pieces of malware will run on a wide range of server operating systems and to do so in an extremely stealthy fashion.\n\nThe Windigo operation does not leverage any new vulnerability against Linux or Unix systems.

The group\u2019s goals and payloads have shifted over time, influenced by the type of compromised infrastructure, but in recent months, they have mostly deployed the Wadhrama ransomware.\n\nThe group most often employs a smash-and-grab method, whereby they attempt to infiltrate a machine in a network and proceed with subsequent ransom in less than an hour.

The redirection led to the installation of Trojanized applications named facebook.apk and chrome.apk that contained Android Trojan-Banker. According to our telemetry data, this malware was detected more than 6,000 times, though the reports came from just 150 unique users (from February 9 to April 9, 2018). Of course, this is down to the nature of the malware distribution, but it also suggests a very painful experience for some users, who saw the same malware appear again and again in their network. More than half of the detections were observed targeting the Asian region.\n\nDuring our research we received some invaluable information about the true scale of this attack. There were thousands of daily connections to the command and control (C2) infrastructure, with the device locale for the majority of victims set to Korean. Since we didn\u2019t find a pre-existing name for this malware operation, we decided to assign a new one for future reference. Based on its propagation via smartphones roaming between Wi-Fi networks, potentially carrying and spreading the infection, we decided to call it \u2018Roaming Mantis\u2019.",

Due to the verification of the Tokopedia breach by multiple researchers and the company itself, ZeroFOX Alpha Team has HIGH confidence that these new breaches are legitimate, and will most likely be available on other breach marketplaces at lower prices in the near future. It is likely that this actor will continue to breach companies and post their content for sale. These tactics proved both successful and profitable for gnosticplayers, and it is likely they will continue to appeal to other breach brokers for these reasons.",

This leaking was done through WikiLeaks, since March 2017. In weekly publications, the dumps were said to come from Vault 7 and later Vault 8, until his arrest in 2018.\n\nMost of the published vulnerabilities have since been fixed by the respective vendors, but many have been used by other threat actors.\n\nThis actor turned out to be a former CIA software engineer.\n\n(WikiLeaks) Today, Tuesday 7 March 2017, WikiLeaks begins its new series of leaks on the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency. Code-named \u201cVault 7\u201d by WikiLeaks, it is the largest ever publication of confidential documents on the agency.\n\nThe first full part of the series, \u201cYear Zero\u201d, comprises 8,761 documents and files from an isolated, high-security network situated inside the CIA\u2019s Center for Cyber Intelligence in Langley, Virgina. It follows an introductory disclosure last month of CIA targeting French political parties and candidates in the lead up to the 2012 presidential election.\n\nRecently, the CIA lost control of the majority of its hacking arsenal including malware, viruses, Trojans, weaponized \u201czero day\u201d exploits, malware remote control systems and associated documentation. This extraordinary collection, which amounts to more than several hundred million lines of code, gives its possessor the entire hacking capacity of the CIA. The archive appears to have been circulated among former U.S. government hackers and contractors in an unauthorized manner, one of whom has provided WikiLeaks with portions of the archive.\n\n\u201cYear Zero\u201d introduces the scope and direction of the CIA\u2019s global covert hacking program, its malware arsenal and dozens of \u201czero day\u201d weaponized exploits against a wide range of U.S. and European company products, include Apple\u2019s iPhone, Google\u2019s Android and Microsoft\u2019s Windows and even Samsung TVs, which are turned into covert microphones.",
